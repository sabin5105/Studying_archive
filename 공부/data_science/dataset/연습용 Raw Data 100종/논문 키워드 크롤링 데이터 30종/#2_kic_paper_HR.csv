1,HR Analytics: Predicting Above Average Commitment by Ranking HR Practices,"이환우 /Lee, Hwan-Woo",2018,한국경영컨설팅학회,"Which HR practices are more important in predicting employee commitment and how might they best be identified? Using classification tree analysis, a data mining technique, we find the priorities between practices the cut-off scores of each. The most important variable to predict above average-commitment employees is “performance management” and the next is “compensation.” Thus, performance management and compensation is a best fit to predict above average-commitment employees. The proposed approach contributes to the HR analytics and SHRM literature by introducing the notion of hierarchy of HR practices in eliciting higher commitment. Our hope is that the model presented in this paper provides a starting place for research and practice examining the role of data mining in HR, and toward the goal of developing effective organizational mechanisms for improving employee commitment.본 논문은 평균 이상의 조직몰입과 가장 연관이 있는 인사제도를 순서 데로 나타내 보임으로써, 방대한 양의 인사관련 데이터의 통계적 분석을 통해 어떻게 조직이 귀납적으로 조직성과 향상을 위한 유의미한 정보를 추출할 수 있는지에 대한 하나의 예시를 제시한다. 한국의 제조업 분야 특정 기업 1,451명의 종업원을 대상으로 한 서베이 데이터를 R을 이용해 트리분석 (tree analysis)을 한 결과, 종업원이 회사의 성과관리 제도에 대한 만족도가 일정 수준 (5점 만점에 3.08)을 넘어서거나, 그렇지 않으면 그 종업원이 보상제도에 대한 만족도가 일정 수준 (5점 만점에 2.83)을 넘어서야 그 종업원은 평균 이상의 조직몰입을 가질 것으로 예측할 수 있었다. 이러한 결과는 최소한 이 회사는 조직몰입 향상을 위해 첫 번째 우선순위로 종업원의 성과관리에 대한 만족도 수준을 관리해야 하고, 이와 더불어 종업원의 보상제도에 대한 만족도 수준을 짝으로 같이 관리할 때 효과적으로 조직몰입 향상을 이끌어 낼 수 있음을 제시한다. 본 연구가 학문적, 실무적으로 유의미하고 다양한 인적자원 Analytics에 대한 연구 활성화에 기여하기를 기대해 본다.인적자원 가치색출 (HR Analytics), 조직몰입, 트리분석 (tree analysis), 전략적인사관리, 빅데이터 마이닝"
2,"HR 부문의 외부연결성, 환경 역동성, 조직의 몰입형 인적자원관리제도 활용 간 관계에 대한 연구: 사업체 패널자료를 중심으로",박지성 /Jisung Park,2018,한국인사관리학회,"본 연구는 기존의 전략적 인적자원관리 분야에서 다소 소홀하게 다루어져 온 몰입형 인적자원관리의 활용을 결정하는 선행요인에 대하여 탐색하였다. 즉, 제도론의 규범적 동형화 논의를 기반으로 HR 부문의 외부 활동, 즉 외부연결성이 어떻게 조직의 몰입형 인적자원관리 활용을 증대시키는 제도적 압력으로 작용하는지에 대해 살펴보았다. 또한, 이러한 제도적 압력과 더불어 경영환경과의 적합성 측면을 동시에 고려할 때 조직의 인적자원관리시스템 활용이라는 현상적 설명을보다 온전히 할 수 있다는 점에서 상황이론을 기반으로 맥락적 상황인 환경 역동성이 갖는 조절효과에 대해서도 검증하였다.

Moreover, considering that the institutional and the environmental pressures simultaneously influence the utilization of organizations’ HR systems, this study explores the moderating effect of environmental dynamism on the positive relationship between an HR department’s external networks and the use of firms’ commitment-based HR system through a contingency theory.
In order to investigate the main and moderating effects, this study conducts the panel analyses with the data of the Workplace Panel Survey (WPS). Consistent with our predictions, analytic results showed that a human resource department’s external networks increased the use of firms’ commitment-based HR system and environmental dynamism attenuated the positive relationship between an HR department’s external networks and the use of firms’ commitment-based HR system. Based on theoretical arguments and empirical findings, this study has implications that an HR department’s activities, the institutional impact, and the environmental pressure should be considered to deeply understand the utilization of organizations’ HR systems.HR Department, Network, Commitment-based HR system, Institutionalism, Contingency Theory"
3,조직 및 HR부서 특성이 HR아웃소싱(Human Resource Outsourcing) 정도에 미치는 영향,차성호,2008,한국인사조직학회,"아웃소싱은 비용절감, 위험감소, 역량구축 등을 위한 목적에서 외부로부터 자원을 공급받는 것이다. 기존의 생산, 정보기술 분야를 대상으로 한 아웃소싱에서 점차 기업경영의 다양한 분야로 확대되면서 HR아웃소싱의 정도도 국내에서 증가되고 있다. 그러나 최근까지 HR아웃소싱에 관한 국내 기업의 현황이나 학문적인 연구가 매우 미흡하다. 본 연구는 국내 기업을 대상으로 기업의 조직특성과 HR의 부문특성이 HR아웃소싱 정도에 어떤 영향을 주는지를 파악하고자 하였다. 따라서 HR아웃소싱 결정요인들 중에서 경쟁전략, 노동조합 또는 노사협의회의 영향력, HR업무의 특수성, HR부서의 역량, HR부서에 대한 지원과 같은 기업의 조직 및 부문특성이 HR아웃소싱 정도와 유의한 연관성을 가지고 있는 지를 규명하였다. 본 연구는 2005년 8월부터 2006년 3월 기간동안 HR아웃소싱을 도입할 예정에 있거나 실제 운영하고 있는 국내 상장기업 및 코스닥기업 164개 기업에 대하여 조사를 수행하였다. 연구의 실증분석 결과에 의하면 첫째, 기업이 차별화전략보다 원가우위전략을 추구할수록, 노동조합 또는 노사협의회의 영향력이 약할수록 HR아웃소싱 정도는 높게 나타났다. 둘째, HR업무의 특수성이 낮을수록, HR부서의 역량이 낮을수록, 최고경영자의 HR부서에 대한 지원이 많을수록 해당 기업의 HR아웃소싱 정도는 높은 것으로 나타났다. 본 연구의 결과는 실무적으로 다음과 같은 시사점을 제공한다. 첫째, 기업의 조직특성 중 경쟁전략과 노동조합의 운영에 있어 HR아웃소싱 정도에 대한 세심한 주의가 이루어져야 한다. 둘째, 기업의 HR부문 특성 중 HR부서 또는 업무의 운영에 있어 아웃소싱 도입시에도 단계적 절차가 필요할 것이다.To survive and grow in rapidly changing business environments, organizations need to obtain
flexibility and competitive edge over other organizations. When organizational resources are
limited, securing high levels of performance in core areas of business is a challenging task.
Under such circumstances, organizations can improve efficiency by outsourcing some management functions to external firms, thereby concentrating organizational resources on high-priority core competency areas. Outsourcing is a way of obtaining resources from outside for the purpose of saving expenses, reducing business risks, and utilizing scarce capabilities. Recently, outsourcing is widely expanding from the field of production and information technology to HR functions. HR outsourcing has also increased in Korean companies over various HR areas from recruitment to compensation management. However, because traditionally human resource policies have not been clearly written in most of Korean companies, research on HR outsourcing has been done only occasionally. So far no empirical study has been published, excepting a few survey reports from business associations. In this situation, this study attempted to investigate what factors are associated with HR outsourcing decisions in Korean companies. In particular, the study examines how HR outsourcing are associated with organizational characteristics such as trade unions and works councils, or HR departmental characteristics such as specificity of human resource services, capability of human resource staffs, and CEO’s support on human resource department. Survey questionnaires were mailed out to HR managers in 1,500 publicly traded companies. Questions focused on the ways and extent they introduced HR outsourcing. 131 HR managers replied to the survey and so the response rate was 15.4%. Research findings are summarized as follows. First, companies whose business strategy is more cost saving oriented, showed higher degrees of HR outsourcing. This implies that HR outsourcing is implemented predominantly for cost saving in HR services. Second, unions and works councils have a negative association with the degree of HR outsourcing. Union workers were inclined to have a negative view on HR outsourcing because it may impoverish HR service qualities and because collective agreements and labor contracts may make the HR outsourcing difficult.
Third, the specificity of human resource services has a significant relationship with HR
outsourcing. That is, the more specific the human resource services are, the lower degree of
HR outsourcing is observed. This implies that HR outsourcing is considered only when the
HR service is very general. HR service providers outside the company can convey the
standardized services with much ease. Fourth, when HR department staff has not much expertise, the degree of HR outsourcing tends to be higher. This is because HR departments become more dependent on HR service providers when it tries to overcome the lack of HR expertise. Fifth, CEO’s support on human resource department has positive effects on HR outsourcing. HR outsourcing is implemented as organizational change efforts, and so the CEO’s orientation toward organizational change helps increase HR outsourcing. The study has limitations as follows. First, it couldn’t take into account all the factors that influence HR outsourcing. Variables that have an effect on HR outsourcing could be numerous. This study examines only a few of them. It is urged that future studies examine more diverse views on HR outsourcing decisions. Further, common method variance problems may exist because measurements were made by survey questions, which could inflate statistical association
among variables. To alleviate common method variance, it is necessary that objective company
data as well as self reports should be balanced in measuring variables.To survive and grow in rapidly changing business environments, organizations need to obtain

In addition, the degrees of a strategic role among firms markedly are diverse, contingent on each organization’s conditions in practice. This gap between reality and the ideals raises the fundamental question - which factors lead to the differences of an HR department’s strategic role among firms? To find the answer to this question, this paper traces the evolution of HR roles, summarizes various HR roles that have been suggested by researchers so far, and particularly reviews four HR roles-strategic partner, change agent, administrative expert, and employee champion-which are typically used in the HR field. In addition, by further focusing on a strategic role, this study investigates which internal and external factors influence the differentiation of an HR department through extensive literature reviews. Based on these literature reviews and theoretical arguments, this study proposes several directions for future research in terms of theories, methodologies, and research implications. In the discussion part, this study suggests theoretical and practical implications and several limitations to future research.human resource department(HR department), strategic role, evolution of HR roles, differences of HR roles"

the DEV in super frame in order that system frame throughput is increased and the delay is decreased. In detail,
the DABL algorithm allows to dynamically allocate channel time as well as to adaptively apply the modulation

different depending on service types, we provide the DABL algorithm taking into account RT(Real Time) traffic

conventional algorithm that the PNC equally allocates channel times to the DEV regardless of the link quality of

In order to evaluate the applicability of HR plates to architectural structures under the KBC 2009 steel design provisions, a total of four full-scale welded built-up H-beams with simple supports were tested together with associated key material testing. The full-scale beam specimens were designed into two categories, or flexural-dominated versus shear-dominated such that both bending and shear strength could be effectively evaluated. The materials test showed that HR plates satisfy both the tensile mechanical properties and the CVN toughness required according to the current material specification. Both the flexural- and shear-dominated specimens exhibited sufficient strengths exceeding the nominal strengths specified in the KBC 2009, thus confirming the applicability of HR plates.HR Plate, Welded Built-up H Beam, Flexural Strength, Shear Strength"

11,HR담당자의 직무특성이 혁신행동에 미치는 영향과 디지털 리터러시의 매개효과 검증,최지원 /JiWon Choi,2019,대한경영학회,"스마트 지식정보사회에서는 모든 환경이 디지털화됨으로써 조직혁신이 조직의 생존과 직결된 문제이다.
조직의 혁신을 위해서 조직구성원의 개인혁신행동이 필요하며, 구성원의 혁신행동으로 조직은 성장하고 발전하게 된다. 조직구성원 각각의 혁신행동은 결국 조직의 혁신으로 이어지기 때문에 구성원들의 혁신행동을유도해낼 수 있는 요인에 관한 연구가 필요하다.
혁신행동의 선행요인에 관한 연구를 살펴보면, 혁신행동에 가장 영향을 미치는 요인은 직무특성이다. 혁신행동은 직무수행 과정에서 발생하며 다양한 요인 중에서 직무 차원이 혁신행동에 가장 영향을 미치고 있음을의미한다. 또한 스마트 지식정보사회에서는 인터넷 환경의 진보로 디지털 리터러시가 개인과 조직의 성과에영향을 미치는 핵심역량으로 부각되고 있다. 조직과 임직원의 역량을 개발하고, 선발, 배치, 평가해야 하는HR인력은 그 누구보다도 디지털 리터러시를 갖추어야 한다.
본 연구의 목적은 HR인력의 직무특성, 디지털 리터러시, 혁신행동 간의 구조적 관계를 파악하고, 직무특성과혁신행동 간의 관계에서 디지털 리터러시가 매개역할을 하는지 실증적으로 검증하는 데 있다. 이를 통해, 4차 산업혁명 시대의 핵심역량인 개인의 혁신행동을 효과적으로 촉진시킬 수 있도록 직무 구성 및 설계, 디지털 리터러시 역량을 높이는 교육 프로그램 개발을 위한 시사점을 제공하고자 하였다. 본 연구를 위해국내 HR인력 437명의 데이터를 사용하여 분석하였다. 연구 결과, HR인력의 직무특성에 대한 인식은 혁신행동에 직접적으로 유의한 영향을 미치지 못하는 것으로 나타났다. 그러나 직무특성 중 자율성은 혁신행동에 유의한영향을 미치는 것으로 나타났다. 특히, 직무특성과 혁신행동의 관계에서 디지털 리터러시는 완전매개역할을하는 것으로 나타났다. 즉 HR담당자의 혁신행동 수준을 제고하기 위해서는 디지털 리터러시를 반드시 고려해야 함을 분석결과를 통해 확인할 수 있었다. 따라서 본 연구는 HR인력의 혁신행동을 촉진하기 위해서, 직무특성과 혁신행동, 디지털 리터러시 간의 구조적 관계를 실증적으로 분석하고 시사점을 제시하고 있다는 점에서의의가 있다.Organizational innovation is an important issue directly linked to organizational survival in this age of information society where all of our environment has been digitized into smart knowledge.
In order to innovate the organization, personal innovation behavior of the members of the organization is essential as organizational growth and development are driven by such behavior of these members.
Therefore, it is necessary to study the factors that can induce the innovation behavior of the members as it leads to organizational innovation.
The research on antecedent factors of innovative behaviors showed the factors that have the greatest influence were job characteristics. This result implies that job level has the greatest influence on innovation behavior among various factors, because it occurs in the process of performing job.
Also, in the smart society, digital literacy is emerging as an essential core competence affecting individual and organizational performance due to the implementation of the Internet environment and the dissemination of innovative IT products. Therefore, HR personnel must need the digital literacy better than anyone else to carry out the tasks of developing, selecting, deploying, and evaluating the capabilities of the organization and its employees.
The purpose of this study was to examine the structural relationship between job characteristics, digital literacy, and innovation behaviors of HR manpower and to verify empirically whether digital literacy plays a mediating role in relationship between job characteristics and innovation behavior. Through this research, we tried to provide suggestions for the development of educational programs that utilize job design and digital literacy to effectively promote individual’s innovation behavior, which is a core competency of the 4th industrial revolution era. For this study, we analyzed the data of 437 domestic HR personnel. As a result, the perception of job characteristics of HR manpower did not directly affect innovation behavior. However, autonomy of job characteristics has a significant effect on innovation behavior.
In particular, digital literacy plays a mediating role in relationship between job characteristics and innovation behavior. In other words, it was confirmed through analysis that the digital literacy is essential to improve the level of innovation behavior of HR personnel. Therefore, this study is meaningful in that it empirically analyzes the structural relationship between job characteristics recognition, digital literacy, and innovation behavior, and suggests implications for promoting innovation behavior of HR manpower.Characteristics, Digital Literacy, Innovative Behavior, HR employee, Mediating Effect"

HR Analytics 연구에서 중요하게 다뤄지는 주제 중 하나가 바로 성과(performance)이다. 특히 고성과자들이 보이는 특성에 대한 가설 검정 (hypothesis testing)과 직원들의 성과 예측(prediction)이 주요 관심사이다. 많은 연구를 통해서 Assessment Center는 선발 및 승진 장면 등에서 높은 준거 타당도를 보인다고 알려져 있는데, 일부 연구에서는 가설의 검정과 예측이 별개의 개념임에도 불구하고 혼재되어 사용되고 있다. 또한, 연구 목적이 가설 검정과 예측의 사이에서 불분명한 경우도 있다. 이에 본 논문에서는 가설 검정과 예측의 근본적인 목적과 분석의 차이를 통계학 관점에서 설명하고, 데이터 분석 방법도 그 목적에 따라 달라져 야 한다는 점을 논의하였다. 더불어, 현장에서는 검정된 가설 못지않게 예측력 또한 중요하므로 Assessment Center 데이터와 개인의 실제 성과를 분석해 가설 검정과 예측의 차이점을 보여주는 사례로 제시하였다. 이를 통해 HR Analytics 학계의 연구자들에게는 가설 검정과 예측의 차이를 분명 히 해야 함을 강조하였고, 현장의 실무자들에게는 직원들의 미래 성과를 예측하기 위해 기존의 데이터 를 어떻게 분석해야 하는지 제시하고자 한다.In response to rapid advances in digital technology and new methods of data analysis, there have been growing interests in HR analytics in both academia and practice. In HR analytics, an important research topic of interest has been performance. Particularly, researchers have been interested in hypothesis testing regarding the characteristics of high performers and prediction of employee’s future performance. Many studies have shown that the assessment center is highly valid for hiring and promoting employees, but the concept of hypothesis testing and the concept of prediction have been mixed in some studies, though the two concepts are clearly different. Furthermore, there have been cases where the research objective is not clear between hypothesis testing and prediction. Therefore, in this article we explain the fundamental difference between hypothesis testing and prediction and their purposes from statistical perspectives, and we argue that the method of data analysis should depend on the purpose. In HR practice, the predictability is as important as a confirmed hypothesis, and to demonstrate the difference between prediction and hypothesis testing we provide an example of individual performance data and assessment center data. We emphasize for researchers that it is critical to distinguish between hypothesis testing and prediction, and we provide HR practitioners guidelines on how to analyze existing data to predict employees’ performances in the future.HR Analytics, Assessment Center, Hypothesis Testing, Prediction, Bibliometrics Analysis, Ordinal Logistic Regression"

However, not many studies have been conducted to examine the relationship between the capabilities of HR departments and organizational effectiveness, not the system.
This study verifies the influence of the HR department's capacity in charge of human resource management on organizational commitment, the mediation effect of job satisfaction and the moderated mediation effect of organizational communication.
According to the analysis, the HR department's Capability had a significant impact on job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and job satisfaction also showed a mediation effect. Organizational communication has been shown to have different influences depending on the industrial form in the moderated mediation effect on job satisfaction.
These results suggest that HR departments need to improve communication systems and pay attention to the type of organization in which members of the organization are engaged and the nature of their duties in order to improve organizational commitment.HR department capacity, organizational commitment, job satisfaction, Organizational Communication, moderated mediation effect"

HR은 이러한 경영진의 요구에 대응하기 위해 HR관련 데이터를 체계적으로 분석하여 인적자원관리의 효과성을 높이고 경영진의 중요한 의사결정을 지원하기 위해 HR Analytics에 대한 관심이 높아지고 있다.

HR의 역할이 본질적으로 경영진과 협업 담당자들을 지원하는 기능이지만, 데이터가 산재해 있고, 이를 분석할 수 있는 기술 부족으로 HR 부서 담당자들의 암묵지로 가지고 있는 정보들이 경영진에게 충분히 전달되지 못하는 경우도 발생하였다. 이를 대리인 비용이라고 할 수 있을 것이다. 연구에서는 최근 관심이 높아지고 있는 HR Analytics가 무엇이고, 도입하게 된 배경을 대리인 이론을 중심 으로 살펴보고자 한다. 또한 국내 대기업에서 HR Analytics를 주요 직책자 자동추천 시스템에 접목하여 경영진 의 의사결정을 지원한 사례를 분석하여 도입 배경과 대리인 이론 관점에서의 시사점이 무엇인지를 파악해 보고자 한다. 그리고 HR Analytics를 적용하고자 하는 기업들에 대한 시사점과 한계점, 그리고 향후 연구 주제를 제안하였다.This study analyzed the application cases of HR Analytics by Korean conglomerate to examine how concepts and technologies like Big data, AI and Machine learning, which are represented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, are being used in HR fields. Until now, HR has been faithfully performing its role as a human resource operation expert by selecting, developing, motivating and providing compensation for human resources necessary for business operation. However, as the complexity of the business environment increases, top executives are demanding more strategic roles from HR to help make decisions related important business. In order to respond to the needs of top executives, HR systematically analyzes HR-related data, increases the effectiveness of human resource management, and increases interest in HR Analytics to support important management decisions. The successful utilization of HR Analytics refers to a system that maximizes the utilization of human resources affecting the business impact as well as the efficiency of HR and can make major decisions related to HR and business based on various data. If HR Analytics is used within an organization, information asymmetry that existed between top executives and HR departments in the past can be reduced. Although the role of HR is essentially a function to support top executives and employees in charge of collaboration, there are cases where data is scattered and the information held by HR department managers' tacit knowledge was not sufficiently delivered to the management due to lack of technology to analyze it. This can be called the agent cost. The reason companies are interested in HR Analytics can be explained as part of efforts the organization, although there are aspects of business expansion and technology development. In this study, we would like to examine what HR Analytics has recently gained interest and the background of its introduction, focusing on the agent theory. From this point of view, this study analyzed the actual application cases of HR Analytics in major decision making processes affecting recommendation system for leader selection and examine how agent theory worked in the process. It also suggested implications and limitations for organizations that want to apply HR Analytics, as well as research topics could develop HR Analytics in the future.HR Analytics, Agency theory, Agency Cost, Leader selection, HR System"

The interest in HR analytics, which started in the early 2000s, has emerged with the advancement of technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data analytics, and many discussions are already underway abroad. On the other hand, there are not enough research related to HR analytics in Korea, so further discussions are required. Therefore, this study summarizes and proposes the research trends and implications of HR analytics through the following three steps, and proposes a framework of HR analytics that future researchers can base on.
First, in the first step, we review the literature of HR analytics studies and derive their implications. As a result of the study, three implications were obtained, each of which is that a sufficient number of conceptual research related to HR analytics has been made, that empirical research is insufficient, and that a more advanced methodology is urgently needed.
In the second step, based on the review of the literature, we will examine the current position of HR analytics and what advanced methodologies are needed for HR analytics in the future. As a result of the research, it can be seen that HR analytics remains at the stage of transitioning from technical analysis to predictive analysis in the business analytics value model, and advanced methodologies such as machine learning are needed to move to prediction and prescription analysis in the future.
Finally, we propose a framework for future researchers based on all the previous contents.

몰입형 HR관행이 독립변수로 포함된 임금함수 분석에는 한국직업능력개발원이 2005년과 2007년에 구축한 인적자본기업패널(HCCP: Human Capital Corporate Panel) 자료를 사용하였다. 연도별로 임금함수를 추정한 결과, 몰입형 HR지수(전체 100점)가 10점 증가함에 따라 임금이 5.6% ～5.8% 상승하는 것으로 추정되었다.
몰입형 HR지수를 직접 임금함수 추정에 사용하는 대신에 대상 기업을 몰입형 HR관행이 평균보다 높은 집단과 평균보다 낮은 집단 등 두 그룹으로 나누고 임금함수를 추정한 분석에서는 2005년보다 2007년이 몰입형 HR관행이 평균보다 높은 집단과 평균보다 낮은 집단의 임금잔차의 격차가 통계적으로 유의하게 더 벌어졌다. 이 결과는 몰입형 HR관행이 시간을 두고 인적자본의 축적에 유의한 영향을 주고 있음을 보여준다.High commitment HR practices has attracted increasing attention in recent years in human resource management based on the theoretical perspective that human resources are valuable, rare, and inimitable intangible strategic assets.
Based on the existing literature review, this study draws the conceptual definition of high commitment HR practices, their underlying factors, and investigates the impact of high commitment HR practices on workers' wage.
The data used in this study are 454 firms from the HCCP(Human Capital Corporate Panel) data collected by KRIVET(Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education & Training) in 2005 and 2007.
The regression analyses of the panel data in both years show that high commitment HR practices have a significant impact on workers' wage. The results indicate that high commitment HR practices have positive impacts not only on the firm performance but also on the accumulation of individual workers' human capital.high commitment human resource practices, wage function, human capital, human capital corporate panel, wage function residuals"

The purpose of this study was to answer the following question: Do SMEs need to focus on different aspects or areas of HR depending on their overall HR maturity? To answer this question, we used the data of 123 SMEs which applied for Korea Best Human Resource Developer Certification(henceforth, Best HRD) in 2009 and in 2010. First, we compared the scores of the SMEs which have been successfully certified as Best HRD companies(Group S) with the scores of the SMEs which have failed to get certified(Group F). Second, among the SMEs in Group S, we identified high performers(Group S1) and compared their scores with those of other SMEs in Group S(Group S2). The analysis showed that the scores on the key areas of HR of the SMEs in Group S(either Group S1 or Group S2) were significantly higher than the scores of those in Group F. Even though the differences between Group S1 and Group S2 were not statistically significant, the HR areas where Group S2 had strengths over Group F and the areas where Group S1 had strengths over Group S2 were different. The former included promotion & rewards, placement, performance management, HRD operation, and the latter included HRD planning & infrastructure, HRM system, and HRD evaluation. The findings suggested that, in order to determine the HR areas a SME needs to focus on and invest its limited resources in, its overall HR maturity should be taken into consideration.Small and Medium Sized Enterprises, HR areas, Best Human Resource Developer Certification"
20,일학습병행제의 HR효과: 횡단 참여기업과 종단 참여기업의 비용편익을 중심으로,성수현 /Su-Hyun， Sung,2018,한국취업진로학회,"최근 ‘일자리정책 5년 로드맵’에 대한 정책평가와 청년층 체감실업률로 인해 정부는 일자리창출과 고용정책을 최대 중점 과제로 안고 있다. 본 연구는 정부 재정사업의 한 축에 있는 도입 4년차 ‘일학습병행제’ 의 경제적 성과를 살펴보고 주요 쟁점에 대한 시사점을 제시하고자 하였다.
기업 측면에서 횡단 참여기업과 종단 참여기업에 대한 비용편익분석을 실시하였다. 횡단 참여기업의 경우, 2013년(5차) 2945.96백만원, 2015년(6차) -37250.12백만원, 2017년(7차) 2463.64백만원으로 2015년(6차)에 마이너스 편익에서 2017년(7차)에 들어서면서 순편익이 발생하였다. 편익/비용비율(B/C)은, 일학습병행제 도입 전 1.19,정(+), 2015년(6차) 0.35로 부(-)적인 영향이 있었고, 2017년(7차)도는 1.08로 B/C≥1로 나타났다. 종단 참여기업의 경우, 일학습병행제 2년차인 2015년(6차) 199.55 백만원으로 시행 전보다 약 54.77% 감소세를 보이다 4년차 2017년(7차) 6226.68 백 만원으로 약 31% 증가한 순편익이 발생하였다. 편익/비용비율(B/C)은, 일학습병행제 도입 전 5.36, 2015년(6차) 1.01, 2017년(7차) 2.63으로 정(+)적인 영향이 있었고, 2015(6차)년도와 2017년(7차)도 각각 1.01 B/C≥1, 2.63 B/C≥1, 로 나타나 일학습병행제가 실효성 있는 청년일자리정책임을 확인하였다.
본 연구 결과에 의한 학문적 시사점과 실무적 시사점은 다음과 같다. 첫째, 학문적 측면에서 John Dewey의 경험이론과 Dawis & Lofquist 직업적응이론을 통해 일학습병행제의 도입취지와 목적에 부합한 이론적 근간을 논하였다는 것이다. ‘고용대란’인 현 시점에서 이론적 도입에 따른 일자리정책의 장기적 대안으로 일학습병행제의 산ㆍ학ㆍ연의 이해를 불러일으킬 수 있는데 의의를 두고자 한다. 둘째, 실무적 측면에서 기업은 일학습병행제를 HR(Human Resources)제도로써 정착시켜야 한다는 것이다. 학습근로자에게 맞는 교육프로그램을 통한 인적개발과 훈련성과에 따른 내부평가나 승진과 보상, 자격인증, 학위연계 등 인적관리 체계가 정착할 때 장기근속, 이직자 감소에 기여할 수 있고, 중소기업 기피현상이나 중도 탈락하는 문제를 근본적으로 해결할 수 있다고 본다. 셋째, 정부는 평생직업교육체제로써 뒷받침을 마련하여야 한다는 것이다. 세계적인 추세에 따라 국가차원에서 제도화하고 있기 때문에 일학습병행제 역시 평생직업교육체제로써 다양한 민족과 계층을 위한 교육화를 마련하여 사각지대가 없이 시기별로 구획되지 않는 연속적 형태의 평생교육을 제도적으로 안착시켜야 한다.Recently, the policy evaluation for the 'Five-year Roadmap on Job Policies' and the unemployment rate for the youth have been the main focus of the government on job creation and employment policy. The purpose of this study is to examine the economic performance of the four - year cooperative learning system on the one hand of the government 's financial business and to suggest some implications for major issues.
In terms of firms, we analyzed the cost benefits of cross-participating companies and end-participating companies. In the case of cross-participating companies, 2013 (5th) will be 2945.96 million won, 2015 (6th) -37250.12 million won, 2017 (7th) will be 2463.64 million won, 2015 (6th) The net benefit was generated. The benefit cost ratio (B/C) was 1.19, positive (+),In 2015 (sixth), there was a negative impact of 0.35, B/C ≥ 1 in 2017 (7th) and 1.08 respectively. For end-The second year of work-related concertation is 199.55 million won (2015)Decrease by about 54.77% compared to before 4th year 2017 (7th) to 6226.68 million wonA net benefit of about 31% increased. The benefit cost ratio (B/C)5.36, before the introduction of work-related concert system, 1.01 (6th) in 2015, There was a positive effect on the ratio of 2.63 (7th) in 2017, 2015 (6th) and 2017 (7th) 1.01 B/C ≥1, 2.63 B/C≥ 1, I have confirmed that my work combination is an effective youth job policy.
The academic implications and practical implications of this study are as follows.
First, in the academic aspect, John Dewey 's theory of experience and Dawis' s and Lofquist' s theory of job adaptation discussed the theoretical basis for the introduction and the purpose of the work-based learning. At the present time, which is the 'employment gap', the long-term alternative of the employment policy based on the theoretical introduction is to raise the interests of industry, academia.
Second, in terms of practicality, companies should set up a work-based learning system as HR (Human Resources) system. It is possible to contribute to the long-term service and reduction of the unemployed when the human resource management system such as internal evaluation, promotion and compensation, certification, I think that the problem of elimination can be fundamentally solved.
Third, the government should provide support for lifelong vocational education system. Since the system is institutionalized at the national level in accordance with the global trend, the work-based learning system is also a lifelong vocational education system, which provides education for various ethnic groups and classes and establishes a continuous type of lifelong education without blind spots.Work-based learning, Cost benefit analysis, Lifelong vocational education, Youth employment policy, HR"

Currently, efficiency and responsiveness are the dominant requirements. Agile organizations have informed the direction of enterprise development, and it is necessary to introduce agile HR strategies.
In this study, employees working in enterprises in the coastal areas of China's trade center were investigated. The survey was conducted through a total of 235 questionnaires from October 3 to October 24, 2018. Finally, 213 questionnaires were collected and used as data and analyzed by SPSS 25.0.
The purpose of this study is to understand how the agile HR strategy of Chinese enterprises affects organizational performance and investigate the mediating effect of collective Intelligence when it comes to the relationship between agile HR strategy and organizational performance.
The results of this study are as follows.
Firstly, agile HR strategy was conceptualized as four distinct dimensions: self-organization, empowerment, job autonomy, and open communication.
Second, results revealed that job autonomy and open communication positively affected job satisfaction; empowerment job autonomy, and open communication positively affected organizational commitment; and self-organization and open communication positively affected collective intelligence.
Third, collective intelligence significantly affected organizational performance.
Fourth, collective intelligence acted as a mediator variable between agile HR strategy and organizational performance.
The verification results showed that some of the four major hypotheses have a significant effect.
Therefore, the adoption of agile HR strategy in a company will increase satisfaction and engagement because employees can self-plan and design work, be empowered, have autonomy in their jobs, and can communicate openly. Agile HR strategy helps organizations grow and evolve as organizational performance improves through collective intelligence, such as knowledge-sharing and collaboration."

To this end, the study selected properties of high-performance HR practices, cooperative industrial relations and organizational performance on the basis of literature review. The study collected 317 units of questionnaire from employees of eight five-star hotels, and found that the sub-factors of high-performance HR practices –selective recruiting, result-oriented evaluation and incentivized compensation– had a significant impact on cooperative industrial relations. Also, training, result-oriented evaluation and cooperative industrial relations showed a significant effect on organizational performance. Verification of the mediating effect of cooperative industrial relations found that selective recruiting and incentivized compensation did not have a significant effect on organizational performance but they did indirectly when cooperative industrial relations mediated. This means that since high-performance HR practices are rooted upon participatory management principles, cooperative relations between labor and management encourage the two parties to consult each other on the proper size of recruitment or incentivized compensation, driving innovation and competitiveness of hotel companies.

In the rest frontal axis of the QRS vector, the control group had a tendency towards right axis deviation. In the rest horizontal amplitude of the QRS vector, the control group had a tendency to show a significant decrease, but it was increased significantly in the exercise group. These findings suggest that inactive company workers was showed a decrease of exercise capacity, early diagnosis exercise-induced ST depression, and prolonged deviation of QRS vector, but that cardiac function could be elevated in active middle aged men through regular exercise program participation."

For empirically finding the area of information privacy within organizational context,this research analyze on the multi-level impacts of organizational HR control type to relations between employee's information privacy perception and behavior.
Empirical results are as follows: The HLM procedure is a two stage strategy that,first, the analysis shows that there was statistically significant variation in the mean of employee behavior, and in the slopes of OCB-I and OCB-O across 41organizations when regressed on information gathering control, legitimacy and information handling control in each organization. Second, the next step in the HLM analysis shows that the impact of HR control on the levels of OCB-I,OCB-O and creative performance was stronger in organizations with result control type. In partially support of hypothesis 2, the result control type was a significant predictor of the variation in the slope of OCB-O regressed on information gathering control. The direction of the result indicated that the impact of information gathering control on OCB-O was weaker when organizations reported higher levels of result control type. Besides HR control type in organization,industry impact on the levels of creative performance, which was weaker when organizations reported to traditional manufacture industry. This study suggest that information privacy is not only individual psychological problem but also organizational phenomena.

34,Do HR Practices Make Social Investment Recoupable? An Introduction to CSR-Supportive HR Practices,장영균 /Youngkyun Chang,2018,한국윤리경영학회,"Although many attempts have been made to disentangle the complex mechanisms through which corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives are translated into financial returns, HR domains have played a minor role in such attempts. This paper introduces a unique set of HR practices, named CSR-supportive HR practices (CSHR) that may affect the ways in which employees implement CSR initiatives, and eventually make social investment recoupable. This paper assumes that CSHR com- prises several bundles of HR practices that may contribute to acquiring, developing, empowering and motivating employees who are willing to be highly dedicated to and engaged in CSR implementation. By emphasizing the roles of HR practices and employees for the efficient CSR implementation, I expand the research scope of CSR from a macro domain to a micro one. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.기업의 사회적 책임(CSR) 활동이 재무적 성과로 환원되는 복잡한 메커니즘을 규명한 수 많은 연구들이 존재하지만, 그 중에 특히 인사 제도 (HR practices)의 역할에 집중한 연구는 매우 희소하다. 본 연구에서는 CSR활동이 재무적 성과로 환원되기 위해서는 CSR 활동의 수행 주체인 종업원들이 고관여(engaged) 상태로 CSR 활동을 효과적이고 효율적으로 수행해야 한다는 전제하에, 그러한 종업원의 고관여 상태에 영향을 주는 인사제도를 이론적으로 추론하고 CSR-supportive HR practices(CSHR)라는 명칭으로 개념화 한다. CSHR은 구체적으로 종업원의 채용, 교육개발, 임파워링, 그리고 동기부여에 관여하여 종업원의 고관여 CSR 실행을 가능하게 한다. 본 연구의 이론화 작업을 통해 CSR 연구가 인적자원관리 및 조직행동 분야로 그 연구의 영역을 확대하기를 고대한다.기업의 사회적 책임(CSR), CSR 지원적 인사제도(CSR-supportive HR practices), CSR 수행, 재무성과"
35,The Influence of HR Manager’s Nationality in Transferring and Implementing HR System,이정언 /JEONG EON LEE,2009,한독경상학회,"This paper aims to focus on the HR system aspect of the firm specific advantages of multinational companies. The study explores the role and effect of staffing with expatriates in a subsidiary in the transfer and implementation of a HR system from headquarters to that particular subsidiary. The transfer of the HR system takes place in the background of institutional duality, country-specific institutional setting and regulations from the parent company. Based on the debate on institutional duality, the study develops a theoretical framework connecting the literature stream about the transfer and implementation of organizational practices in terms of expatriate influence on the HR system and the expatriate roles to gain a better understanding about transfer and implementation mechanisms of HR systems in subsidiaries of multinational companies. The theoretical model provided in this study gives a first insight into the influence of the subsidiary HR manager’s nationality on the transmission of the HR system from headquarters to subsidiaries and the resulting degree of overlap between the two systems. Three variables identified-the level of reputational effectiveness, the level of allegiance to the subsidiary and the level of parent country language skills of the HR manager in a subsidiary-are hypothesized to influence the overlap between the HR system at headquarters and subsidiaries.해외기업이 본사의 인적자원관리제도를 현지에 적용하는 과정에는 다양한 형태의 결과를 이끌어 내는 상이한 요인들이 존재한다. 이와 같은 이유로 해외기업 현지 인사관리자는 본사 지향적 인사정책의 적용뿐만 아니라 현지의 인사관행을 유지해야 하는 이중적인 상황을 경험한다. 본 연구는 제도적 차원에서뿐만 아니라 현지 인사관리자 개인과 관련된 요인을 고려하여 해외기업의 본사와 현지 인적자원관리제도의 중첩 정도를 이론적인 접근방법을 통해 제시하였다.

The review of previous research includes strategic uses and measurements of HR, and analyses of the 7-step model by Becker and Huselid.Based on the Balanced ScoreCard Collaborative (hereafter, BSCol), the practical method of HR evaluation, and managerial use of HR Scorecard are suggested. In addition, a real world case that could clearly explain the viewpoints of this thesis was introduced.HR can be measured in five domains; strategic skills/capability, leadership, organizational culture/strategic recognition, strategic alignment, integration of strategies and learning. It is urged to develop a report on the intangible assets, e.g., the human capital readiness report. The human capital readiness report shows how well human resources support the strategic needs of an organization. It is a link between the corporate strategies and the HR strategies. It also communicates HR strategies to organizational members and shows the achievement.Strategic planning is the first step toward successful development of the human capital readiness report. Linking HR strategies to organizational strategies and preparing the chart of organizational strategies are essential in this stage.BSC, HRM"

S3669 and PI15225, which carrying the Tsw gene, were mechanically inoculated with TSWV-Pap, and then maintained in growth chambers at temperatures ranging from 15 ± 2°C to 30 ± 2°C (in 5°C increments). Seven days post inoculation (dpi), a hypersensitivity reaction (HR) was induced in inoculated leaves of PI152225 and S3669 plants maintained at 25°C ± 2°C. Meanwhile, necrotic spots were formed in upper leaves of 33% of PI15225 plants maintained at 30 ± 2°C, while systemic mottle symptoms developed in 50% of S3669 plants inoculated.
By 15 dpi, 25% of S3669 plants had recovered from systemic mottling induced at 30 ± 2°C. These results demonstrated that resistance to TSWV-Pap can be overcome at higher temperatures in both C. chinense and C. annuum. This is the first study reporting the determination of temperatures at which TSWV resistance is overcome in a C. annuum genetic resource expressing the Tsw gene. Our results indicated that TSWV resistance shown from pepper plants possess the Tsw gene could be overcome at high temperature. Thus, breeders should conduct evaluation of TSWV resistance in pepper cultivars at higher temperature than 30°C (constant temperature)."

Evolution in the dots size and dots density in the stacked structures is strongly influenced by the dot formation in the under-layer and the structure of the spacer layers. AFM results revealed that the dots formation on the top can be changed by increasing the number of stacked QDs. However, the dots formation is not vertically aligned since HR-XRD measurement gave different satellite peak on n-stacked QD structures. Room-temperature PL measurements show variation in the PL spectra, where blue-shifted PL peak positions are observed when the number of stack is increased.

44,Expression of Hr-Erf Gene during Ascidian Embryogenesis,Jung Eun Kim,2013,한국발생생물학회,"FGF9/16/20 signaling pathway specify the developmental fates of notochord, mesenchyme, and neural cells in ascidian embryos. Although a conserved Ras/MEK/Erk/Ets pathway is known to be involved in this signaling, the detailed mechanisms of regulation of FGF signaling pathway have remained largely elusive. In this study, we have isolated Hr-Erf, an ascidian orthologue of vertebrate Erf, to elucidate interactions of transcription factors involved in FGF signaling of the ascidian embryo. The Hr-Erf cDNA encompassed 3110 nucleotides including sequence encoded a predicted polypeptide of 760 amino acids. The polypeptide had the Ets DNA-binding domain in its N-terminal region. In adult animals, Hr-Erf mRNA was predominantly detected in muscle, and at lower levels in ganglion, gills, gonad, hepatopancreas, and stomach by quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) method. During embryogenesis, Hr-Erf mRNA was detected from eggs to early developmental stage embryos, whereas the transcript levels were decreased after neurula stage. Similar to the QPCR results, maternal transcripts of Hr-Erf was detected in the fertilized eggs by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Maternal mRNA of Hr-Erf was gradually lost from the neurula stage. Zygotic expression of Hr-Erf started in most blastomeres at the 8-cell stage. At gastrula stage, Hr-Erf was specifically expressed in the precursor cells of brain and mesenchyme. When MEK inhibitor was treated, embryos resulted in loss of Hr-Erf expression in mesenchyme cells, and in excess of Hr-Erf in a-line neural cells. These results suggest that zygotic Hr-Erf products are involved in specification of mesenchyme and neural cells."
45,Factors Affecting HR Analytics Adoption: A Systematic Review Using Literature Weighted Scoring Approach,Suchittra Pongpisutsopa,2020,한국경영정보학회,"In the era of disruptive change, a data-driven approach is vital to Human Resource Management (HRM) of any leading organization, for it is used to gain a competitive advantage. HR analytics (HRA) has emerged as innovative technologies since advanced analytics, i.e., predictive or prescriptive analytics, were widely used in the High Performing Organizations (HPOs). Therefore, many organizations elevate themselves to become HPOs through Data Science on the “people side.” This paper proposes a systematic literature review using the Literature Weighted Scoring (LWS) to develop a conceptual framework based on three adoption theories, which are the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE), Diffusion of Innovation (DOI), and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The results show that a total of 13 theory-derived factors are determined as influential factors affecting HRA adoption, and the top three factors are “Quantitative Self-Efficacy,” “Top Management Support,” and “Data Availability.” The conceptual framework with hypotheses is proposed to provide a foundation for further studies on organizational HRA adoption."
46,잠언에 등장하는 ‘음녀’(hr'z＂)와 ‘이방 계집’(hY＂rIk.N＂)의 번역 문제 -잠언 2장과 5장을 중심으로-,이희학 /Lee Hee Hak,2007,(재)대한성서공회 성경원문연구소,"The purpose of this paper is to reveal the nature and identities of hr'z""(adulteress) and hY""rIk.N""(gentile gal) of the Proverbs, and to suggest the exact Korean translations of the words. For that purpose the text of the Proverbs Chapter 2 and 5 is closely analysed. The nature and identities of these women have been discussed for a long time. Yet it is not easy to find out the exact meanings of the words, and scholars have been differently translated. Thus these increase the difficulties for the present task. Only close analysis of each text can help us grasp the clear and distinct meanings of the words, whether hr'z"" is a professional prostitute, a strange foreign woman, living in Israel, or another man’s wife, living next-door. What is obvious is that hr'z"" is a dangerous woman, who can destroy the life and the happiness of a young man, and jeopardize the order and the well-being of a community. Generally speaking, hY""rIk.N"" means either a woman, who is not someone’s own wife, or a foreign woman, who is not Israelite.
The analysis of Chapter 2 and 5 leads to the following conclusions. Firstly, hr'z"" should be more comprehensively understood. hr'z"" of Chapter 2 and 5 has its own character and nature, so they should be differently translated. hr'z"" of Chapter 2 is in her character and actual life a lewd and prodigal woman, who married early but left her husband, so she means a ‘lewd wife’, who is a licentious married women. Thus, translating hr'z"" of Chapter 2 as a ‘lewd’, ‘licentious’ or ‘prodigal’ woman weakens her marital status too much. Yet hr'z"" of Chapter 5 does not have any lewd character. Thus she should be translated as neither a ‘lewd’, ‘loose’ nor ‘prodigal woman’, but ‘another woman’, who is attractive and whom a young man can encounter anywhere during his social life. Secondly, the traditional understandings of hY""rIk.N"" should be revised. This word does never mean a foreign woman specifically at least in the Proverbs 2:16 and 5:20. The translation of hY""rIk.N"" as a foreign or ‘gentile gal’ misses the exact intention of the Proverbs text. Furthermore, calling a girl or woman as ‘gal’ implies the sexual discrimination against women in general, so it is better not to use the word, ‘gal’. Rather hY""rIk.N"" indicates all woman, including foreign women, who is not someone’s own wife or sweetheart. Therefore, this word might be best translated as neither a ‘adulterous woman’ nor ‘another man’s wife’ but a ‘strange woman.’Strange Woman, Wisdom, Proverbs 2, Proverbs 5, Bible translation"

54,The Antecedents and Outcomes of HR Diversity Management in China,펭판 /Peng fan,2020,한국유통경영학회,"Purpose: As the important effect of diversity on improving organization’s competitiveness, diversity management has become a hot issue in the organizations. But, there is a dearth of research regarding how to implement diversity management practices under a boundary context. To stress the gaps by previous research, this study aims at providing an integrated framework on why and how to implement diversity management in the Chinese context. Three main research questions are explored in this study: a) What motivates the organization to implement DM? b) Can HR diversity management be beneficial for the organization? c) How to implement HR diversity management in the Chinese context?Research design, data, and methodology: A 437 questionnaires were collected from domestic and foreign-owned firms in China. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to check the adequacy of the measurement components of the proposed model. And, a structural equation model (SEM) was conducted in Mplus 7.4 statistical package to test the relationships between antecedents, outcomes and HR diversity management.
Results: This study found that business driver, legislation driver and CSR driver were significantly related to top management’s commitment to diversity management. In particular, the CSR driver had the strongest impact on top management’s commitment to diversity management. Top management’s commitment to diversity management was positively related to HR diversity management. Further, the findings showed that HR diversity management was positively related to organizational performance(i.e., innovation performance and HR performance).
Conclusions: The appropriate DM approach has not reached a consensus and managing diversity is still a challenge for most organizations. Given the important effect of stakeholder on providing sustainable competitive advantage, the organizations should put effort into applying diversity management from a social responsibility perspective. The results highlight the critical role of top management in the implementation of HR diversity management. In order to establish a complete HR diversity management system, the top managers should provide more commitment to DM, which not only include the positive attitude towards diversity issues, but also contain direct and indirect support. As the results have shown, HR diversity management provide practitioners with a good starting point to improve innovation performance and HR performance."

Due to energy and particle separation ability, a vortex tube can be used as the main component of the CO2 absorption device. In this study, experimental approach has been performed to analyze the energy separation characteristics of the vortex tube. To obtain the preliminary design data, energy separation characteristics of the vortex tube has been tested for orifice diameter, nozzle area ratio, and tube length. As a result, the orifice diameter is the major factor of the vortex tube design. The nozzle area ratio and tube length have a minor effect on the energy separation performance. For Dc=0.6D, AR=0.14∼0.16, and L=16D, maximum energy separation has been occurred. The result from this study can be used as the basic design data of the 100 Nm3/hr class vortex tube applied to the CO2 absorption device.

Based on systematic reviews of the aging, performance, and knowledge management literatures, we discuss the implications of aging workforce which remains unexplored from the viewpoint of knowledge management. Also, building on previous studies on aging issues and knowledge management, we propose four knowledge- transferring HR practices–interpersonal relation (mentoring and OJT) and organizational structure (communities of practice and job rotation). We statistically test the utilities of these practices in the workforce aging-organizational performance relationship through 405 firms in the HCCP datasets (2007 calendar year). Results showed that the proportion of the aging workforce was negatively related to organizational performance. In addition, mentoring of the interpersonal relation knowledge- transferring HR practices and CoP of organizational structure ones had statistically significant moderating effects. On the other hand, OJT and job rotation did not have any significant moderating roles in the aging- organizational performance relationship. More specifically, firm performance rather increases when the firms have mentoring or CoP even though the negative effect of aging workforce on firm performance; on the contrary, firm performance deteriorates drastically when the firms do not have such knowledge-transferring HR practices. These theoretical discussions and empirical results call for reevaluation of aged employees and proper ways to transform their valuable knowledge and experience into organizational assets.aging workforce, organizational performance, knowledge management, mentoring, OJT, CoP, job rotation"

59,Small punch test and simulation of HR3C steel,이택상,2018,대한기계학회,"As the traditional uniaxial test requires substantial amount of cost and material usage for specimen, it is hardly applied to the direct diagnosis of structural integrity of in-service facilities. Small punch (SP) test has been, alternatively, introduced to procure material properties because SP test just needs a slice of material (10 ´ 10 ´ 0.5 mm) which can be easily obtained from real components without loss of integrity. In this study, for HR3C steel, SP tests were carried out and its three-dimensional finite element (FE) model was also developed to cross-validate the test results. Scanning electron microscope images for SP specimens were taken and compared with crack propagation simulation results generated by the extended finite element method. Furthermore, the minimum thickness change of specimen during the test was measured by several interruption tests. Configuration of SP test specimen was intensively observed with respect to punch displacement by both experiment and FE analysis, respectively."
60,Building an Electronic Personnel Management System for HR Administration: Centered Around the Case Example of PPSS,윤병수 /yun byeong su,2005,한국인사행정학회,"In an increasingly high-tech world, human resource management (HRM) has to keep abreast of these changes. In the advanced countries, governments and industry have long since adopted e-HRM, in order to meet global challenges. In handling this exponential growth of data, the CSC has decided to move away from its current paper-centric personnel management system and to replace this by the PPSS. This electronic system manages a full range of personnel related processes and is in the final stage of deployment across the Korean central government agencies. In doing so, it has achieved for itself a high scoring, in terms of perceived benefit. Its rollout to other government agencies (that include local government, the National Assembly, the National Election Commission and the Constitutional Court of Korea) is now fully supported. HR management by the PPSS replaces current manual processes, with its inherent paper dependency, by a system that now offers strategic planning potential and affording its users core access at any time and from multiple work-stations. This paper lists factors that help towards a successful implementation. It highlights the lessons learned by a detailed analysis of a case study for a typical installation. The paper also addresses the expectations for potential users, at all levels of operation. As with all electronic and digital systems, the essential security requirements are discussed, and its role in building the trust and confidence in its routine use."

The metabolic profiling of intact human colorectal tissues was performed using high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR spectroscopy, which was unnecessary to extract metabolites from tissues. We used two different groups of samples, which were defined as normal and cancer, from 9 patients with colorectal cancer and investigated the samples in NMR experiments with a water suppression pulse sequence. We applied target profiling and multivariative statistical analysis to the analyzed 1D NMR spectra to identify the metabolites and discriminate between normal and cancer tissues. Cancer tissue showed higher levels of arginine, betaine, glutamate, lysine, taurine and lower levels of glutamine, hypoxanthine, isoleucine, lactate, methionine, pyruvate, tyrosine relative to normal tissue. In the OPLS-DA (orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis), the score plot showed good separation between the normal and cancer groups. These results suggest that metabolic profiling of colorectal cancer could provide new biomarkers."

Hairless mice (SKH1-hr) were used to study the early diagnosis of radiodermatitis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) isozymes were analyzed using nativepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting of blood serum and tissues collected from SKH1-hr mice. Radiodermatitis developed 24 days after the first X-irradiation. Reduced spleen weight was observed after the last X-irradiation (P<0.05). Thereafter the weight increased until 24 days after the first irradiation, finally reaching levels comparable to those in the sham-irradiated control group. LDH activity was the highest in skeletal muscle and lowest in blood serum. LDH C4, A4, A3B, A2B2, AB3, and B4isozymes were detected, in the mentioned order, from the cathode. This result was similar in other mouse strains. In the irradiated group, LDH A4 isozyme levels were reduced in the serum until inflammation occurred, whereas those of B4 isozyme were elevated. The subunits A and B followed a similar trend to that of LDH A4 and B4 isozyme, respectively. Importantly, antibodies against LDH B4isozyme could prove useful in the early diagnosis of radiodermatitis."
66,Law and Development of Cuba under US-led Sanctions and its Implications for HR757,이수현,2017,서울대학교 국제학연구소,"This paper examines the law and development of Cuba under the duress of US sanctions, examining impacts and consequences of those sanctions as well as their socio-political and economic reasons. By configuring sanctions as the departure point of this analysis of Cuba’s law and development, this paper provides an analysis of parallels that can be drawn to the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016, or “HR757”. By identifying the similarities between HR757 and the sanctions placed against Cuba, this paper shows that the unpredictable impacts of the Cuba sanctions can be extrapolated to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).
The unique features of the Cuban revolutionary narrative during an equally extraordinary period in modern history christened the economic sanction of the Cold War era: targeted not at specific actions, but rather the personality of a State and its behaviour. The strong ideological language in these sanction mechanisms ignited equally ideological recalcitrance against them by Cuba. One can identify similar trends in the DPRK, though at significantly larger stakes with access to innovatively destructive instruments of war. The high stakes of this final front of the Cold War make it imperative to ensure that sanctions, as perhaps one of the final steps before military action, are informed rather than absolved by history."

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) of organochlorine pesticides such as dieldrin, were analyzed in sedimentary rock and granite rock collected from greenhouses, Niigata, Japan. Dieldrin remains in Japanese farming soils, more than 40 years after their use as insecticides was prohibited. The averages in soil moisture ranged from 2.79% to 7.20% in soils derived from sedimentary rock and from 25.59% to 31.40% in soils derived from granite rock. Mean concentrations of dieldrin residues in sedimentary rock and granite rock were 39.7 ng g-1 and 40.51 ng g-1, respectively. Dieldrin residue was detected at a slightly higher concentration in granite rock than sedimentary rock samples. There was no consistency between the two soils or between surface and subsurface soils. The coefficients of variation of the two soils were 10.6% and 8.7%, respectively. These results suggest that our high-resolution mass spectrometry detector (HR-GC/MS) is effective at analyzing residual organochlorine pesticides in soil. In order to increase the precision and sensitivity for chemical analysis of POPs, high-resolution gas chromatography coupled with a HR-GC/MS is highly recommended."

PM concentrations are significantly enhanced by primary particle emissions from traffic sources. Recently, in order to reduce CO2 and increase fuel economy, gasoline direct injected (GDI) engine technology is increasingly used in vehicle manufactures. The popularization of GDI technique has resulted in increasing of concerns on environmental protection. In order to better understand variations in chemical composition of particulate matter from emissions of GDI vehicle versus a port fuel injected (PFI) vehicle, a high time resolution chemical composition of PM emissions from GDI and PFI vehicles was measured at facility of Transport Pollution Research Center (TPRC), National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER), Korea. Continuous measurements of inorganic and organic species in PM were conducted using an Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToFAMS).
The HR-ToF-AMS provides insight into nonrefractory PM composition, including concentrations of nitrate, sulfate, hydrocarbon-like and oxygenated organic aerosol, and organic mass with 20 sec time resolution. Many cases of PM emissions during the study were dominated by organic and nitrate aerosol.
An overview of observed PM characteristics will be provided along with an analysis of comparison of GDI vehicle versus PFI vehicle in PM emission rates and oxidation states."

71,HR BSC를 통한 전략적 인적자원관리와 조직성과의 관계,조영복 /Cho，Young-Bohk,2006,한국인사조직학회,"인적자원관리(HRM)가 조직성과 향상에 직접적으로 기여하기 위해 전략적인 경영도구로써 그 역할이 변모될 필요가 있다. 이러한 필요성에 의해 등장한 전략적 인적자원관리(SHRM)의 효과적 도입과 실행에 있어 중요한 요소는 SHRM 실행 성과를 객관적으로 측정하기 위한 시스템의 체계적 정립이라 할 수 있다. 본 연구는 SHRM과 조직성과 간의 관계에 있어 SHRM 성과시스템이 재무성과 중심의 편향된 조직성과를 재무적비재무적으로 균형된 조직성과로 개선을 가져오는지를 실증적으로 분석하고자 하였다. 이를 위해 조직성과에 대한 선행변수로 HRM 전략 및 조직문화 특성요소와 두 변인 간의 관계를 매개하는 요인으로 인적자원 균형성과시스템(HR BSC)과의 관계를 살펴보았다. 우리나라 112개 상장기업(BSC를 도입한 기업과 그렇지 않은 기업에 대한 짝지은 검증)을 대상으로 분석한 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, HRM 전략과 HR BSC 간에는 유의한 관계가 있는 것으로 나타났다. 특히, 구축형 및 배치형 전략은 HR 재무성과가 높고, 획득형 전략은 HR 전략 및 HR 고객성과가 더 높은 것으로 나타났다. 둘째, 조직문화 특성요소와 HR BSC 간에는 유의한 관계가 있는 것으로 나타났다. 특히 개인-조직가치 적합성을 강조하는 조직은 HR 재무성과가 높고, 혁신지향적 조직은 HR 전략 및 HR 고객성과가 더 높은 것으로 나타났다. 셋째, 동일한 HRM 전략 및 조직문화를 가진 기업이라 하더라도 HR BSC를 도입하고 있는 기업의 전체 조직성과가 더 높은 것으로 나타났고, 재무적 비재무적 조직성과도 균형적으로 높은 것으로 나타났다. 이상의 결과에서 조직성과의 향상을 위해서는 조직에 맞는 HRM 전략과 조직문화를 형성하는 것뿐 아니라, 경쟁우위의 원천인 인적자원의 효과적인 관리를 위한 SHRM의 실행과 그러한 과정을 통해 창출되는 성과와 가치를 균형있게 평가하기 위한 성과지표가 함께 관리될 필요가 있음을 보여주었다.This study examines relationships among human resource strategy (HRS), organizational culture, human resource performance, and organizational performance. By using organizational typology of Miles and Snow (1978), we classify HRS in three categories: acquiring HRS of prospectors, allocating HRS of analyzers, and building HRS of defenders. We also classify organizational culture into four categories; innovation oriented culture, relation oriented culture, task oriented culture, and hierarchy oriented culture. In addition, we measure human resource performance according to four dimensions of human resource balanced scorecard (HR BSC): strategic, operational, customer, and financial performance. To validate those relationships, we compare 58 companies that utilize HR BSC with 54 companies that do not utilize HR BSC. Analysis shows that 1) the effects of HR strategy on human resource performance differ according to HR BSC dimensions used for measuring HR performance, 2) the effects of organizational culture and person-organizational value fit on human resource performance differ according to HR BSC dimensions used for measuring HR performance, 3) the effects of culture types of organizations on human resource performance differ according to HR BSC dimensions used for measuring HR performance, and 4) the effects of HR performance on organizational performance differ according to BSC dimensions used for measuring HR performance and BSC dimensions used for measuring organizational performance. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.SHRM, Organization Value fit, Organizational Culture, Organizational Performance, BSC, HR BSC, Measurement & Evaluation 攀*Professor, Department of Management, Pusan National University, Korea"

메카닉 신체와 관련된 대표적인 작가들 중에서 HR. 기거는 외계 생물체를 창조해 낸 인물로 1980년 아카데미에서 비쥬얼효과상을 수상하였으며, 그의 새로운 신체에 관한 바이오메카노이드(Biomechanoid)는 에일리언(Alien)과 같은 영화를 통해 대중적으로 널리 알려져 있다. 그는 끔찍한 외계 생물의 창조자라고 협소한 평가를 받기도 하지만, 바이오메카노이드는 현대 자연과학의 오용에 따른 부정적인 결과를 보여주고 있다는 점에서 의미가 있다. 이것은 20세기 대중문화가 낳은 수많은 메카닉 신체와 HR.기거의 바이오메카노이드의 차이점기도 하다. 또 다른 차이점은 처음부터 생식기관을 거쳐 태어나 스스로 자라는 능동태적인 피조물이라는 것이다. 
따라서 본 논문은 그의 대표적인 작품이라고 할 수 있는 <바이오메카노이드 시리즈>에 표현된 주요 모티브의 상징의미를 표현면과 내용면으로 나누어 분석함으로써 바이오메카노이드의 상징성을 분석하였다. 그 결과 출생 전․후의 병든 태아는 생명의 창조를 상징하는 에로스(Eros)와 죽음을 상징하는 타나토스(Thanatos)를 동시에 보여주고 있음을 알 수 있었다. 이것은 작가가 제 2차 세계대전 중에 태어나 20대에 1960년대 전쟁, 전체주의, 인종학살, 테러리즘, 자연파괴를 경험하면서 느꼈던 인간의 악한 본성을 표현한 것이기도 하다.
HR.기거의 바이오메카노이드는 단순히 기괴한 취향에 의해 창조된 것이 아니라 20세기의 대중문화와 조형예술사, 역사를 반영하고 있는 시대의 아이콘이라고 할 수 있다.HR.Giger, biomechanoid"
73,HR-1 Mice: A New Inflammatory Acne Mouse Model,장용현 /Yong Hyun Jang,2015,대한피부과학회,"Background: There is no appropriate in vivo animal model that reflects the inflammatory response of human acne.
Objective: This study investigated the effect of Propionibacterium acnes on the development of inflammatory acne-like lesions in four mouse strains with different degrees of immune response for the development of an optimal mouse model of inflammatory acne. Methods: Human P. acnes suspensions (108 and 109 colony forming unit [CFU]/μl) were injected into the backs of HR-1, BALB/c, vitamin D receptor-knockout (VDR k/o), and severe combined immunodeficiency disease mice. Inflammation levels were evaluated two weeks after injection of P. acnes suspensions. In addition, histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining of the expressions of inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., CD4＋/CD8＋ T lymphocytes, neutrophils, myeloperoxidase, interleukin-1β, matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, LL-37, and integrin α6) were performed on tissue specimens. Results: The HR-1 mouse strain exhibited the most remarkable inflammatory reaction with epithelial proliferation and microcomedone-like cyst formation. HR-1 mice also demonstrated aberrant integrin expression in the epidermis around both inflamed lesions and newly formed microcomedones. These findings were more prominent in the group receiving 109 CFU/μl P.
acnes than 108 CFU/μl. MMP-9 expression in HR-1 mice was also upregulated around the microcomedone-like cysts. Finally, expression levels of TLR-2 and LL-37 were higher in HR-1 and BALB/c mice than the VDR k/o and SCID mice strains. Conclusion: P. acnes induces acneiform inflammation with small microcomedones in HR-1 mice. Therefore, the HR-1 mouse strain represents a good candidate for the development of a new inflammatory acne mouse model."

Further, their strength is substantially affected by environmental conditions. Therefore, in this study, the effect of temperature was analyzed by performing a tensile test and a fatigue test. It was observed that the yield strength, the ultimate strength, and the fatigue life decreased relatively with an increase in temperature. Further, an S-N curve can be predicted by using the results of the tensile test and a micro-Vickers hardness test.Fatigue, Fatigue Fracture, High Impact Polystyrene, Composite, Polymer, S-N Curve"

In the regiocentrism and geocentrism, MNCs are pursuing both global integration and localization in the HR side. Some orientations are identified and discussed in the perspective of the global HRM: core value sharing and transmission, building employment brand across the world, and constructing global career development system. Colleges are trying international programs competitively. But the performance is low because of incongruence with the needs of global firms. This paper addresses the debate about the existing colleges’ international program and proposes the global talent development platform for meeting the needs of global firms.

본 연구는 가족친화적 조직문화 형성에 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있는 다섯 가지인적자원관리 제도로 개인-조직 적합성을 중시한 선발, 교차훈련, 결과지향적 평가,성과급, 광범위하고 유연한 직무설계를 제시하였다. 이러한 제도들의 가족친화적 조직문화 지각에 대한 주효과 및 가족친화제도와의 상호작용 효과를 규명해 보기로 하였다.
이에 대한 실증적 검증을 위해 종업원 50인 이상 규모의 조직에서 근무하는 근속 2년이상의 정규직 기혼근로자 554명을 대상으로 설문조사를 실시하여 자료를 수집하였다.
분석 결과, 본 연구에서 도출한 HR 제도들은 대체적으로 가족친화적 조직문화 지각에매우 유의미한 영향력을 지니는 것으로 밝혀졌으며, 가족친화제도와의 상호작용은부분적인 효과를 지니는 것으로 밝혀졌다.
본 연구가 주는 가장 중요한 이론적 시사점은 선행연구자들이 향후 연구과제로 제시했던“어떻게 종업원의 일-가정 균형에 지지적인 조직환경을 형성할 수 있을 것인가?“의 문제에대한 답을 찾고자 했다는 점이다 특히, 이러한 문제에 대하여 일-가정 양립에 가장 큰영향을 미치는 요소지만 그동안 논의가 미흡했던 HR 제도 측면에서의 접근을 시도하였다는 점에서 그 의의가 있다고 하겠다. 또한 가족친화제도와 관련하여 인적자원관리의내적 적합성을 설명할 수 있는 가능성을 보여 주었다는 점에서도 중요한 의미를 지닌다.Managing the work-family balance has lately become an important issue for organizations. Changesin workforce demographics, such as increases in dual-earner households and single-parent families,as well as individuals’ pursuit of work-life balance have led organizations and governments toinstitute work-family initiatives. Researches on these initiatives’ effects with respect to employees’job-related attitudes have shown mixed results. Studies posit that work-family initiatives are differentfrom other HR practices in that they can lead to a negative outcome or backlash from their use.
Despite the importance, it is still unclear how firms can create an environment that supports bothwork and family. To try and answer this question, this study explores the possibility that specificHR practices can play a role in creating a positive work-family culture while positively changingemployee attitudes. Furthermore, the authors use signaling theory and the internal fit of HR practicesto argue that achieving good alignment between work-family initiatives and consistency of HRpractices can create a stronger work-family culture in organizations, and increase employee perceptionof a work-family culture.
Using a cross-sectional survey data over 554 married, and full-time employees in 60 large firmsin Korea, the study examined the main effects on perceived work-family culture of five differentHR practices corresponding to the five major areas of HR system in organizations: staffing focusedon P-O fit (selection), cross-training (training), results-oriented appraisal (performance appraisal),pay for performance (compensation), and broadly and flexibly-designed jobs (job design practice).
Results demonstrate that individual HR practice is significantly positively related to perceivedwork-family culture, supporting our hypotheses that HR practices, individually, positively influencework-family culture. However, the results provide limited support for the hypothesis the interactionbetween work-family initiatives and HR practices positively influences perceived work-family culture.
Among the five HR practices studied, two HR practices–cross-training and results-oriented appraisal–can lead to a significant increase in perceived work-family culture when combined with work-familyinitiatives. The study demonstrates weak evidence for the complementary relationship between work-family initiatives and HR practices in increasing work-family culture. The results indicatethat HR practices which support employee flexibility, autonomy, and perceived control may generatea positive synergy with work-family initiatives and thus help create a family-supportive culturein organizations.
The findings extend our limited understanding of how organizations can create work-familysupportive cultures and in particular, how HR practices can play a role in creating a work-familyculture in organizations. The results provide practical implications in that the adoption andimplementation of work-family initiatives alone may not be enough to create a work-family culture.
Organizations should combine certain HR practices along with work-family initiatives to createstrong work-family supportive cultures. Additionally, the findings shed light on a few specific HRpractices that can contribute to creating a work-family culture. To further understand the impactof HR practices on work-family culture, and ultimately employee attitudes and behavior, futureresearch should examine the interactions or complementary mechanisms between multiple HRpractices and work-family initiatives.work-family initiatives, perceived work-family culture, signaling theory, internal fit of HR practices"

Because there were little concerns about the moderating effect of HR department’s role on the relationship between participation programs and organizational performance, and also showed little consistency in the results.
To examine the hypotheses of this study, we use the 428 data of “Workplace Panel Survey(WPS)” conducted by Korea Labour Institute in 2009 for the samples of independent variables of union’s involvement on organizational outcomes, and 2011 WPS data for the dependent variables of financial performance as well as labor costs, for clarifying causality.
The result shows that union’s participation positively influences on financial performance while negatively influences on labor costs. Strategic decisions influence financial performance while HR role’s moderating effects on the relationship betweenlabor union’s involvement on organizational outcomes are supported partially. As we didn’t separate HR role into two parts such as change leading and strategic role, HR role’s moderating effects on the relationship between labor costs show inconsistent. This is due to using archival data of WPS. Further researches can follow up this issue by categorizing HR according to more specific roles."

In this study, we predicted that job-based HR would play a positive role in job engagement by functioning as a job resource suggested by the Job Demands-Resources Model.
Based on these research backgrounds, this study examined the effect of job-based HR on job engagement. We also verified the mediating effects of person-job fit and work meaningfulness to identify the mechanism of job-based HR to the performance in the relationship between job-based HR and job engagement. Data for analysis was collected from 236 employees taking MBA courses at Time1 and Time2.
As a result, job-based HRM has a significantly positive(+) influence on job engagement. Also, it has a significantly positive(+) influence on person-job fit and work meaningfulness, and a significant mediating effect of person-job fit and work meaningfulness in the relationship between job-based HR and job engagement.
In conclusion, we suggested theoretical and practical implications of this research based on analysis results, with its limitations and future research directions.job-based HR, job engagement, person-job fit, work meaningfulness"

infection and the virus spreads systemically causing a severe disease characterized by necrotic lesions throughout the plant. 
To identify the viral protein that elicits
this necrotic response, we used a set of hybrid viruses constructed by combination of TMV-Cg and the tobacco mosaic virus strain U1 (TMV-U1). In this study we present evidence that the coat protein of TMV-Cg (CPCg) is the elicitor of the necrotic response in tobacco

the HR lesions. In addition, defense-related genes and detoxifying genes are induced in tobacco Xanthi-nn plants after TMV-Cg and U1-CPCg inoculation. 
We postulate that in our system, CPCg is recognized by sensitive tobacco plants that mount an incomplete defense

ARPS에서 필요한 기준 움직임의 값으로 POCS 복원의 이전 단계에서 추정한 움직임 벡터의 값과 위상 상관도법으로 얻은 값을 이용하여 연산량을 줄였다. 또한, 추정된 움직임을 정규화하여 그 정확도를 더욱 향상시켰다. 실험 결과, 전체 탐색 블록 정합법과 POCS를 동시에 수행하여 영상을 재구성한 경우와 비교했을 때 유사한 화질의 HR 영상을 약 30배 빠르게 재구성하였다.In POCS (projection onto convex sets)-based reconstruction of HR (high resolution) image, the quality of reconstructed image is gradually improved through iterative motion estimation and image restoration. The amount of computation, however, increases because of the repeated inter-frame motion estimation. In this paper, an HR reconstruction algorithm is proposed where modified ARPS (adaptive rood pattern search) and POCS are simultaneously performed. In the modified ARPS, the motion estimates obtained from phase correlation or from the previous steps in POCS restoration are utilized as the initial reference in the motion estimation. Moreover, estimated motion is regularized with reference to the neighboring blocks' motion to enhance the reliability. Computer simulation results show that, when compared to conventional methods which are composed of full search block matching and POCS restoration, the proposed method is about 30 times faster and yet produces HR images of almost equal or better quality."

However, because previous studies on job-based HR have focused mainly on the necessity and directions for job-based HR, there have not been sufficient case studies on the specific methods, process, and performance regarding the introduction and operation of job-based HR.
Based on the background, this study explores the structure and performance of job-based HR with a focus on the case of SAP. SAP is a firm that has a standardized job-based HR that of capable of overseeing personnel dispersed throughout the world. It has also successfully operated a job-based HR system within Kore's business environment and culture. As such, this study selected SAP as a case to be examined because it has significant implication for Korean firms.
This study has the following research objectives. First, we analyzed the structure of SAP's job-based HR in terms of SAP's HR guideline, SAP's GJA(Global Job Architecture) - a job architecture that standardized and formalizes SAP's job-based HRs, and SAP's job-based HR policies(including recruitment, promotion and progression, performance evaluation, compensation and development) that were based on the HR guideline and GJA. Second, we analyzed the performance of SAP's job-based HR according to three aspects - operational efficiency, global talent management, and strategic performance.
In the conclusion, we suggested implication for improving HRM in Korean firms and operation job-based HR more efficaciously, based on the detailed contents of SAP's job-based HR.job-based HR, SAP, GJA, performance of job-based HR"

As medium resources are limited, the optimal medium time required for each device needs to be estimated to share the resources efficiently among devices. This paper proposes a variable-service interval-based resource allocation algorithm to efficiently make a reservation of medium resources based on a parameterized QoS. In other words, the proposed algorithm calculates the number of medium access slots (MASs) based on TSPEC, local resources, and local conditions and determines suitable locations for the MASs within a superframe to accommodate more devices. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can accommodate more devices and has greater than 10% resource allocation efficiency in an HR-WPAN compared to existing schemes."

To determine its anti-obesity effects, we performed anti-obesity-related experiments in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our present study was carried out to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of herbal extracts using a high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model and 3T3-L1 adipose cells. The effects of each herbal extracts on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells were examined using Oil Red O staining. Results showed that treatment with each herbal extracts at 10~100 μg/㎖ had no effect on cell morphology and viability. Without evidence of toxicity, herbal extracts treatment decreased lipid accumulation compared with the untreated adipocytes controls as shown by the lower absorbance of Oil Red O stain. Futhermore, compared with control-differentiated mature adipocytes, each herbal extracts significantly inhibited lipid accumulation in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In the HFD-fed obese mice, body weight, liver weight and white adipose tissue weights were significantly reduced by mixture of herbal extracts administration in mouse skin. Futhermore, we found that mixture of herbal extracts administration suppressed serum triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TCHO) in HFD-induced obese mouse model. The mixture of herbal extracts of permeability was estimated by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value in pig skin. The optimized formulations of herbal extracts (Test 3 formulation) showed skin permeation. However, test 1 formulation containing essential oil as enhancer showed maximum skin permeation. After confirming the enhanced skin permeability, in vivo studies were performed to assess whether skin irritation potential on the basis of a primary irritation index (PII) in rabbit skin. Reactions were scored for erythema/edema reactions at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-application. It was concluded that the test 1 formulation was not irritation (PII = 0). The present study suggests that the test 1 formulation might be of therapeutic interest with respect to the treatment of obesity."
105,A Longitudinal Test of Two Competing Perspectives About the Effects of HR Systems on Firm Performance,양혁승 /Hyuckseung Yang,2003,한국경영학회,"This study was conducted to contribute to the human resource management (HRM) literature by testing the validities of two competing perspectives on configurational features of human resource (HR) systems: universalistic and fit perspectives. Propositions were set up based on the two competing perspectives. First, drawing on the universalistic perspective, it was expected that the effectiveness of an HR system would be proportional to the extent of use of a set of high-performance HR practices. Second, drawing on the fit perspective which takes into account the interactions among HR practices, it is expected that the effects of an HR system on firm performance would depend on the degree of fit among HR practices composing the HR system.
The hypotheses based on the first proposition were not supported, while the hypotheses based on the second proposition were supported. Two key features of this study are that it relies on a broad array of HR practices rather than a small set of high-performance HR practices to empirically derive HR systems and that it is a longitudinal study.본 연구는 조직의 성과에 영향을 미치는 인적자원관리 시스템의 구성적 (configurational) 특성에 관하여 경쟁적 위치를 점하고 있는 두 가지 관점-보편주의적 관점과 적합성 관점-에 기초하여 명제와 가설을 설정하고 이를 실증적으로 검정하였다. 우선, 보편주의적 관점에 따르면 인적자원관리 시스템이 조직성과에 미치는 효과는 해당 시스템 내에서 고성과 인적자원관리 제도가 활용되는 정도에 비례한다고 볼 수 있다. 반면, 개별 인적자원관리 제도들간 상호작용을 고려하는 적합성 관점에 따르면 인적자원관리 시스템이 조직성과에 미치는 효과는 해당 시스템을 구성하고 있는 개별 인적자원관리 제도들간 적합성 정도에 따라 달라진다고 볼 수 있다.
실증검정 결과는 보편주의적 관점에 기초하여 설정된 가설들은 지지를 받지 못한 반면, 적합성 관점에 기초하여 설정된 가설들은 실증적으로 지지를 받았다. 본 연구가 기존의 연구와 다른 두드러진 특징은 인적자원관리 시스템을 분류함에 있어 소수의 고성과 인적자원관리 제도들만을 분석에 포함시키기보다는 광범위한 인적자원관리 제도들을 분석에 포함시켰다는 점과 두 시점에서 데이터를 수집하여 종단분석을 시도하였다는 점이다.인적자원관리, 인적자원관리 시스템, 보편주의적 관점, 적합성 관점"

이에 따른 인사제도 실행에 관한 시사점이 논의되었다.To deepen the understandings for effective HR (human resource) practices implementation, strategic HR researchers are paying attention to examining withinorganization variance of employees’ HR perceptions which are based on individual differences. The current study aims to expand the individual difference-based approach to HR practices implementation by drawing on the literature of strategic human resource management and individual affectivity. To this end, the influence of individual affectivity on the relationships between commitment-based human resource management practices and two types of prosocial behaviors(organizational citizenship behavior and knowledge sharing) were examined. In the analysis of moderation with data collected from 590 individuals, positive and negative affectivity turned out to be significant moderators for the hypothesized relationships. Specifically, the slopes between commitment-based human resource management practices and prosocial behaviors were more positive under high levels of positive affectivity or low levels of negative affectivity. Implications for these findings in pursing effective HR practices implementation were discussed.Commitment-based HR Practices Perceptions, HR Practices Implementation, Affectivity, Prosocial Behaviors, Organizational Citizenship Behavior(OCB), Knowledge Sharing"
107,Genetic Organization of the hrp Genes Cluster in Erwinia pyrifoliae and Characterization of HR Active Domains in HrpNEp Protein by Mutational Analysis,Rosemary Shrestha,2008,한국분자세포생물학회,"The disease-specific (dsp) region and the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp) genes, including the hrpW, hrpNEp, and hrpC operons have previously been sequenced in Erwinia pyrifoliae WT3 [Shrestha et al.
(2005a)]. In this study, the remaining hrp genes, including the hrpC, hrpA, hrpS, hrpXY, hrpL and hrpJ operons, were determined. The hrp genes cluster (ca. 38 kb) was comprised of eight transcriptional units and contained nine hrc (hrp conserved) genes. The genetic organization of the hrp/hrc genes and their orientation for the transcriptions were also similar to and collinear with those of E. amylovora, showing ≥ 80% homologies. However, ORFU1 and ORFU2 of unknown functions, present between the hrpA and hrpS operons of E. amylovora, were absent in E. pyrifoliae. To determine the HR active domains, several proteins were prepared from truncated fragments of the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions of HrpNEp protein of E. pyrifoliae. The proteins prepared from the N-terminal region elicited HR, but not from those of the C-terminal region indicating that HR active domains are located in only N-terminal region of the HrpNEp protein. Two synthetic oligopeptides produced HR on tobacco confirming presence of two HR active domains in the HrpNEp. The HR positive Nterminal fragment (HNΔC187) was further narrowed down by deleting C-terminal amino acids and internal amino acids to investigate whether amino acid insertion region have role in faster and stronger HR activity in HrpNEp than HrpNEa. The HrpNEp mutant proteins HNΔC187 (D1AIR), HNΔC187 (D2AIR) and HNΔC187 (DM41) retained similar HR activation to that of wildtype HrpNEp. However, the HrpNEp mutant protein HNΔC187 (D3AIR) lacking third amino acid insertion region (102 to 113 aa) reduced HR when compared to that of wild-type HrpNEp. Reduction in HR elicitation could not be observed when single amino acids at different positions were substituted at third amino acids insertion region. But, substitution of amino acids at L103R, L106K and L110R showed reduction in HR activity on tobacco suggesting their importance in activation of HR faster in the HrpNEp although it requires further detailed analysis."

The sources of resistance were nonspecific to pathotypes of the bacterial spot pathogen. Near-isogenic lines (NIL) of hypersensitive resistance (HR) genes developed by incorporation Bs2 and Bs3 into ‘Chilseong’ reacted differentially to race 1 and race 3 of the bacterial spot pathogen. Bs2 NILs were hypersensitive to both race 1 and race 3 but Bs3 NILs were resistant to race 1 but susceptible to race 3. The differential reaction of the NILs was clearly observed in the field when transplanted to the field after inoculation with both races."

There were many attempts to identify the effectiveness of such HR system and practices, among which a few research has performed in order to improve our understanding of mediating variables inside the 'black box' of the firms.
This research is aimed to reveal the mediator roles of organizational trust and psychological empowerment on the relationship between high involvement HR system and employee commitment in relations to organizational commitment and change commitment. For this purpose, 278 employees who joined any public and private organizations completed the questionnaires and LISREL was employed. The findings are: Firstly, The empirical findings of the effects of the high commitment HR system on the organizational productivity in terms of commitment to organization and change were not supported. Secondly, the mediators of organizational trust and psychological commitment were predicted from the high commitment HR system. Moreover, mediator roles of organizational trust and psychological empowerment on the relationship between high commitment HR system and organizational productivity were confirmed.

Here we present evidence that the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the Hr gene has internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity and this activity is regulated by the binding of poly (rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) to Hr mRNA. Overexpression and knockdown of PCBP2 resulted in a decrease in Hr 5′ UTR IRES activity and an increase in HR protein expression without changing mRNA levels. We also found that this regulation was disrupted in a mutant Hr 5′ UTR that has a mutation responsible for Marie Unna hereditary hypotrichosis (MUHH) in both mice and humans. These findings suggest that Hr mRNA expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level via IRES-mediated translation control through interaction with PCPB2, but not in MUHH."
113,공간의 시학 - 후버르트 피히테의 『교수형 받은 자들의 광장』과 파울 뷔어의 『잘못된 책』을 중심으로,김경희 /Kim Kyung Hee,2011,한국헤세학회,"Die Frage nach der Bedeutung des Raumes in der Literatur reicht in der Literaturwissenschaft weit zurück. Kulturelle Prozesse werden immer auch durch die Zeit-Räume bestimmt, die sie begleiten und das was wir als Kultur und Geschichte verstehen, erscheint in diesen Möglichkeitswelten oft als erfundene Welt oder als Entwurf. Wie sich gezeigt hat, werden politische und ökonomische Veränderungen oft von Veränderungen der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien begleitet, in deren Kontext sich Wissensformationen herausgebildet hatten. In der jüngeren Geisteswissenschaft hat man sich über die eigenen Fachgrenzen hinaus mit seismografischem Gespür auf die Suche nach solchen Veränderungen gemacht. Inter- und Transdisziplinarität sind in diesem Sinne nicht nur modische Strömungen, sondern sie sind vielmehr die Paradigmen, die diese Epoche erfordert. Andererseits “bemächtigen” sich die Raumkonzepte, wie sie in den unterschiedlichen Disziplinen und darin durchaus auch interdisziplinär z. B. in Mathematik, Philosophie, Geografie, Ethnologie, Literaturwissenschaft, Soziologie usw. vertreten werden, auf verschiedene Weise der Räume und entfalten dabei auch kreatives Potenzial. Beispielhaft soll diese Poetisierung des Raumes anhand der Interpretation von zwei Romanen, dem Platz des Gehenkten von Hubert Fichte und Das falsche Buch von Paul Wühr erläutert werden.
Der Platz des Gehenkten von Hubert Fichte ist ein Roman aus der Reihe “Geschichte der Empfindlichkeit”, dessen Schauplatz der Marktplatz in Marrakesch ist. Die Exotik der Geschichte wird durch die emotionslose Wortwahl und die distanzierte Perspektive gesteigert. Formal präsentiert der Roman das Geschehen als Momentaufnahme und Reportage, ohne logische Sequenzialität und ohne die Identität des Erzählers preiszugeben. Der Roman beschreibt die Oberfläche des Beobachtbaren als poetische Ethnologie. Es handelt sich um eine entdramatisierte Erfahrung des Fremden. Dem gegenüber behält Das falsche Buch von Paul Wühr die Trennung zwischen Realem und Fiktionalem aufrecht, was sich jedoch durch die Verschachtelung der Lebensverhältnissen zunehmend verkompliziert. Der Romanraum bezeichnet in diesem Sinne einen “real-fiktiven” Raum. In Duane Michals Foto Things are queer (1973) findet die Prozesshaftigkeit, mit der die Schwellen der Räume überschritten werden, eine diesem unendlichen Spiel aus Fiktion und Realität entsprechende Analogie.

Materials and Methods: Three adult female rats were randomly assigned as test subjects, with 1 rat serving as a control subject. For 20 weeks, the test rats received a weekly intravenous injection of 30 μg/kg zoledronic acid, and the control rat was administered a similar dose of normal saline. Bilateral extraction of the lower first and second molars was performed after 10 weeks. All rats were scanned once every 4 weeks with both micro-CT and HR-MRI. Micro-CT and HR-MRI images were registered and fused in the same 3-dimensional region to quantify blood flow velocity and trabecular bone thickness at T0 (baseline), T4 (4 weeks), T8 (8 weeks), T12 (12 weeks), T16 (16 weeks), and T20 (20 weeks). Histological assessment was the gold standard with which the findings were compared.
Results: The histomorphometric images at T20 aligned with the HR-MRI findings, with both test and control rats demonstrating reduced trabecular bone vasculature and blood vessel density. The micro-CT findings were also consistent with the histomorphometric changes, which revealed that the test rats had thicker trabecular bone and smaller marrow spaces than the control rat.
Conclusion: The combination of micro-CT and HR-MRI may be considered a powerful non-invasive novel technique for the longitudinal quantification of localized mineralization and vascularization"

Method : After 50 mg/kg of sorafenib treatment, GJD 100 mg/kg was administered with 3.5 hr-intervals.
The plasma were collected at 30 min before administration, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hrs after end of first and last 7th sorafenib treatment, and plasma concentrations of sorafenib were analyzed using LC-MS/MS methods. PK parameters of sorafenib (Tmax, Cmax, AUC, t1/2 and MRTinf) were analysis as compared with sorafenib single administered rats.
Results : GJD markedly inhibited the absorption of sorafenib, from 1 hr to 24 hrs after end of first 3.5 hr-interval co-administration, the Cmax (-43.27%), AUC0-t (-56.29%) and AUC0-inf (-66.70%) of sorafenib in co-administered rats were dramatically decreased as compared with sorafenib single treated rats. However, GJD significantly increased the absorption of sorafenib, from 4 hr to 8 hrs after end of last 7th 3.5 hrinterval co-administration, the AUC0-t (34.08%) and AUC0-inf (37.31%) of sorafenib in co-administered rats were dramatically increased as compared with sorafenib single treated rats.
Conclusion : Although GJD decreased the oral bioavailability of sorafenib through inhibition of gastrointestinal absorptions after end of first 3.5 hr-interval co-administration, it is observed that GJD increases the oral bioavailability of sorafenib as facilitated the absorption after end of last 7th repeated co-administration.
Hence, the co-administration of GJD and sorafenib should be avoided in the combination therapy of sorafenib with GJD on anticancer therapy"

We hypothesized that HR involvement will have both direct and indirect--via commitment-based HR system--effects on HR effectiveness. HR involvement was measured in two ways: the existence of HR executive by institutional involvement and the degree of involvement of the HR executive or department in firm's strategic decision making by substantial involvement. Commitment-based HR systems were measured based on the work of Arthur(1992) and HR effectiveness was measured as the extent to which the line manager felt that HR function contributed to implementation of strategy and firm performance. Regression results from 286 public firms in Korea indicated that HR involvement was strongly related to perceptions of HR effectiveness as hypothesized.

First, The main concern of content-based approach is an effective HR system usually defined as a well designed set of HR practices necessary for achieving a firm’s strategy, such as high performance or high commitment work systems. Research in this area focuses on exploring the direct relationship between HR systems and firm performance or internal processes that how HRM practices can improve firm performance. Second, unlike a content-based approach, a process based approach highlights the way messages of HRM communicated to employees. The role of HRM practices is to send messages to employees that allow them to understand the desired and appropriate responses in order to achieve an organizational goal (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004). Research in this area focuses on the communication role of the HR practices that how they should be implemented in order to allow employees to clearly perceive what is needed. Given a desired content of the HRM system, the HRM system may still not elicit appropriate collective behaviors and attitudes needed for effectiveness, because individuals may interpret the HRM practices idiosyncratically,leading to variability in psychological climate perceptions (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004). Therefore,the manner in which HRM is implemented is very important. Despite the impotance of studies on the process of HRM system in the field of strategic human resource management research,however, most previous works have concentrated on the content of HRM system.
Along this line of reasoning, Bowen & Ostroff (2004) proposed the concept of the strength of human resource management (HRM system strength) as comprising three features: distinctiveness,consistency, and consensus. which are required to allow employees to properly perceive what the HRM system is intended. Although the theoretical implication of Bowen & Ostroff (2004)’s HRM system strength have been supported by many researchers, there is very limited number of empirical studies on the processes and outcomes of it because of the absence of its appropriate measurement. In particular, few research on the HRM system strength has been performed in the context of Korea (Kang et al., 2011).
In this regard, using process-based approach, we examined the effect of HRM system strength on HR effectiveness placing emphasis on the role of communication for improving the HR effectiveness.
HR effectiveness, defined as a firm’s HR activities contribute to the achievement of a firm’s strategic goals, is an important antecedent of firm performance (Ryu & Kim, 2007; Wright et al., 2001). Despite its importance, a study on communication role of HR department to allow HRM to be implemented effectively have not been tried. This study fills this void. In addition,based on the work of Bowen and Ostroff (2004), we examined if HR climate, defined as employees’shared perceptions of the HR system, has a mediating effect in the relationship between HRM system strength and HR effectiveness. HR climate seems to be predicted directly by HRM system strength, but the empirical findings suffer from a lack of agreement (ex: Li, Frenkel, & Sanders,2011; Sanders, Dorenbosch, & Reuver, 2008). On basis of a literature review, the following hypotheses were postulated:Hypothesis 1: HRM system strength is positively related to HR effectiveness.
Hypothesis 2: HRM system strength is positively related to HR climate.
Hypothesis 3: Climate strength has a mediating effect in the relationship HRM system strength and HR effectiveness.
We analyzed data through questionnaire instruments from 72 strategic planning function executives and 443 full-time employees from 72 Korean firms in several industries. To reduce possible common method variance, two separate questionnaires, one for the independent and mediation variable and the other for the dependent variable, were used. To investigate these hypotheses, hierarchical regression analysis and sobel test were employed, and the size, firm age, industry, union presence,and high performance work systems (HPWS) were controlled in the model.
The results shows positive relationships between HRM system strength and HR effectiveness.
Also, the mediation effect of HR climate on the relationship between HRM system strength and HR effectiveness was partially supported.
This study advanced our understanding of the mechanisms linking HR systems to HR effectiveness by focusing on the process of HRM. Based on the empirical evidence of this study, the scientific community of HRM can state that organizational members can share common perceptions of HRM practices, and thus, HRM can be effective when HRM has three features of distinctiveness, consensus,and consistency as theorized by Bowen & Ostroff (2004).Process Based Approach, HR System Strength, HR Climate, HR Effectiveness"

By the end of 2007, Korea had 62,988 cases of direct investment in China, which is 49.9% of total direct investments abroad. Korea’s investment is worth US$22.5 billions, which is 24.6% of total investment abroad.
Despite growing investments, Korean firms in China have not been performing effectively so far. According to Kim(2006), 56.8% of Korean firms reported deficit in 2005. One of the most important reasons for the performance gap has been found to be ineffective management of human resources in these firms(Lee, 1998). Because Chinese employees tend to have values and behavior patterns that are different from Koreans, Korean firms have faced problems in managing Chinese employees. Similar problems are reported among western companies in China(Lasserre & Ching, 1997; Weldon & Vanhonacker, 1999; Wong & Law, 1999).
These developments demonstrate the importance of effective human resource management (HRM) at Korean firms in China, but studies have so far been mostly anecdotal or simple surveys at best. 
In this paper, we studied the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness for Korean firms operating in China, applying universalistic and contingency approaches of strategic human resource management. To our knowledge, there has been no such study previously. According to the universalistic approach, it is expected that commitment-based HR system of Korean firms operating in China is positively related with HR effectiveness. According to the contingency approach, it is expected that the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness is moderated by organizational contingencies. Organizational contingencies such as competitive strategy and expatriate staffing were studies in this paper. Specifically, we proposed the following hypotheses.

H1：Commitment-based HR system in Korean firms operating in China will be positively related to HR effectiveness.
H2：Cost leadership strategy in Korean firms operating in China will moderate the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness, with the relationship being weaker in firms having higher cost leadership strategy.
H3：Differentiation strategy in Korean firms operating in China will moderate the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness, with the relationship being stronger in firms having higher differentiation strategy.
H4：Expatriate staffing rate in Korean firms operating in China will moderate the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness, with the relationship being weaker in firms having higher rate of expatriate staffing.

To test these hypotheses, we conducted a survey of Korean firms with at least 50 employees. The survey was conducted in Qingdao, Yantai, and Waihai, where the largest cluster of Korean firms is located. Questionnaires were sent to 200 firms and 139 firms replied to the survey. After dropping questionnaires that contained unanswered items, the final sample size for this study was 130. 

Hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze data. Results revealed that commitment-based HR system in Korean firms operating in China was positively related to HR effectiveness(H1). Also it was found that expatriate staffing moderated the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness, with the relationship being stronger in firms having higher localization of human resources(H4). These results suggest that Korean firms will be better off by using commitment-based HR system and increasing localization of human resources in China. However, the moderation of differentiation strategy was not found to be significant(H3). 
Also, contrary to Hypothesis 2, cost leadership strategy moderated the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness, with the relationship being stronger in firms having higher cost leadership strategy. We think this happened because of idiosyncrasies in Chinese workers and the Chinese labor market. Specifically, Korean firms with the cost leadership strategy were smaller than the firms with the differentiation strategy. Also the former used more temporary workers and were more likely to be in manufacturing rather than in service sector. This means that Korean firms with the cost leadership strategy mostly entered the Chinese market to take advantage of low labor costs and their HRM was mostly control-oriented. Employees under such HR system would respond very favorably when the company increases its use of commitment-based HR system. We think this is the reason that commitment-based HR system and cost leadership strategy had positive interaction. However, this relationship needs to be thoroughly studied before making any conclusions. 
This study has the following limitations. First, we used 10 HR practices to measure commitment-based HR system. A more elaborate measurement could ensure a more correct measurement. Second, we used a single item to measure cost leadership strategy. Future studies can improve on this by using more items to measure cost leadership strategy. Finally, the same person answered a whole questionnaire, which causes common method bias. The most effective remedy will be employing multiple respondents.China is Korea’s largest trading partner and its importance is growing over time. By the end of 2007, Korea had 62,988 cases of direct investment in China, which is 49.9% of total direct investments abroad. Korea’s investment is worth US$22.5 billions, which is 24.6% of total investment abroad.
Despite growing investments, Korean firms in China have not been performing effectively so far. According to Kim(2006), 56.8% of Korean firms reported deficit in 2005. One of the most important reasons for the performance gap has been found to be ineffective management of human resources in these firms(Lee, 1998). Because Chinese employees tend to have values and behavior patterns that are different from Koreans, Korean firms have faced problems in managing Chinese employees. Similar problems are reported among western companies in China(Lasserre & Ching, 1997; Weldon & Vanhonacker, 1999; Wong & Law, 1999).
These developments demonstrate the importance of effective human resource management (HRM) at Korean firms in China, but studies have so far been mostly anecdotal or simple surveys at best. 
In this paper, we studied the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness for Korean firms operating in China, applying universalistic and contingency approaches of strategic human resource management. To our knowledge, there has been no such study previously. According to the universalistic approach, it is expected that commitment-based HR system of Korean firms operating in China is positively related with HR effectiveness. According to the contingency approach, it is expected that the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness is moderated by organizational contingencies. Organizational contingencies such as competitive strategy and expatriate staffing were studies in this paper. Specifically, we proposed the following hypotheses.

H1：Commitment-based HR system in Korean firms operating in China will be positively related to HR effectiveness.
H2：Cost leadership strategy in Korean firms operating in China will moderate the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness, with the relationship being weaker in firms having higher cost leadership strategy.
H3：Differentiation strategy in Korean firms operating in China will moderate the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness, with the relationship being stronger in firms having higher differentiation strategy.
H4：Expatriate staffing rate in Korean firms operating in China will moderate the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness, with the relationship being weaker in firms having higher rate of expatriate staffing.

To test these hypotheses, we conducted a survey of Korean firms with at least 50 employees. The survey was conducted in Qingdao, Yantai, and Waihai, where the largest cluster of Korean firms is located. Questionnaires were sent to 200 firms and 139 firms replied to the survey. After dropping questionnaires that contained unanswered items, the final sample size for this study was 130. 

Hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze data. Results revealed that commitment-based HR system in Korean firms operating in China was positively related to HR effectiveness(H1). Also it was found that expatriate staffing moderated the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness, with the relationship being stronger in firms having higher localization of human resources(H4). These results suggest that Korean firms will be better off by using commitment-based HR system and increasing localization of human resources in China. However, the moderation of differentiation strategy was not found to be significant(H3). 
Also, contrary to Hypothesis 2, cost leadership strategy moderated the relationship between commitment-based HR system and HR effectiveness, with the relationship being stronger in firms having higher cost leadership strategy. We think this happened because of idiosyncrasies in Chinese workers and the Chinese labor market. Specifically, Korean firms with the cost leadership strategy were smaller than the firms with the differentiation strategy. Also the former used more temporary workers and were more likely to be in manufacturing rather than in service sector. This means that Korean firms with the cost leadership strategy mostly entered the Chinese market to take advantage of low labor costs and their HRM was mostly control-oriented. Employees under such HR system would respond very favorably when the company increases its use of commitment-based HR system. We think this is the reason that commitment-based HR system and cost leadership strategy had positive interaction. However, this relationship needs to be thoroughly studied before making any conclusions. 
This study has the following limitations. First, we used 10 HR practices to measure commitment-based HR system. A more elaborate measurement could ensure a more correct measurement. Second, we used a single item to measure cost leadership strategy. Future studies can improve on this by using more items to measure cost leadership strategy.

The ongoing debate is whether the subsidiary’s HR system should be similar with the local organizations or with the headquarters. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the IHR policy and HR effectiveness. We used the survey data gathered by the Korea Labor Institute for the Korean firm in China in 2007. The sample was 141 Korean subsidiaries in China. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The results are as follows. The HR effectiveness was higher when the subsidiary’s HR system was similar with the headquarters than when it was similar with the locals. The interaction between the headquarters similarity and a differentiation strategy was positively related with the HR effectiveness. Contrary to the hypothesis, the interaction between the headquarters similarity and a cost leadership strategy was negatively related with the HR effectiveness. The reason could be due to the distinct characteristics of the Korean subsidiaries in China. Based the research results, we discussed implications, limitations and future research directions.IHRM policy, HRM similarity, competitive strategy, HR effectiveness"

The research derives four core topics after scrutinizing case studies on evaluation, promotion, compensation and rank system which are main composition of HR management system. The internalization of global HR system will first create proper career path, job satisfaction, employment stability and loyalty; it will eventually highlight the enhancement of strategy for global competency through optimizing HR management, employee commitment, productivity improvement, and elite manpower.
The four main findings of aforementioned are as follows. First, the evaluation system shall be based on ability-oriented rather than seniority-oriented to improve objectivity and reliability of the evaluation. Furthermore, the system needs more subdivided categories for evaluation to measure personal weakness more accurately and make an improvement on it. Second, assigning more critical roles and responsibilities for promoted employees improve their capability and job performance skill, which in turn will lead to higher reliability in a belonging organization. Third, stabilizing the compensation system of paying the allowance for those who receive different salaries will increase the flexibility in mobilization of employees in different countries. This system will lead to continuous work for the employees eventually leading to job stability. Finally, imposing a rank system based on roles and responsibilities can give a guideline for employees’ career path along with appropriate expertise and technique.HR, global HR management system, structure of HR management system, structure of HR strategy, global HR strategy"

In this study, an experimental investigation is carried out to examine the relationship between the anisotropy in impact values and the fatigue strengths of SM490A with respect to the rolling direction of test specimens. All test specimens failed around 1,500,000 cycles regardless of the test specimen direction. Therefore, it is found that the anisotropy in impact energy is not related to the fatigue strength of the materials considered in this study. However, the transverse direction specimen showed more rapid brittle fracture mode compared to that of longitudinal direction specimen, and this appears to be related to the lower impact values in transverse direction.Steel plates, Hot rolled coil, Impact values, Transverse, Longitudinal, Anisotropy, Fatigue strength"

The findings of the study were as follows.
The seven practices of SHRM, which were selective hiring, extensive training, compensation contingent on organizational performance,participative job design, extensive sharing of financial and performance information, reduction of status differences and employment security suggested by Pfeffer(1997), turned out to be useful for organizational performance involving job satisfaction, organizational commitment and turnover intention. Thus, the importance of SHRM was proven. When the relative importance of the subvariables of SHRM was checked, the relative importance of extensive sharing of financial and performance information was largest, and that of employment security was smallest.
The hypothesis that the two subvariables of the HR's department role characteristics, which include the characteristics of strategic partners,those of change agents, might have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between SHRM and organizational performance was partially accepted.SHRM, HR's department role characteristics, Organizational performance"

To define concept of the fit between business strategy and HR throughflow types, research model was developed 2x2 matrix which is based on matching perspective. We hypothesized that prospector-building dimension will shows higher organizational performance than other dimensions. We forecast defender-acquiring dimension will shows lower performance. Data were collected through questionnaire instruments from both HR managers and planning manager in 704 mid-small firms. Research findings are summarized as follows. The prospector-HR building dimension has a positive and significant effect on organizational performance. Second, defender-HR acquiring type shows the most low effect on organizational performance.HR throughflow types, business strategy, organizational performance"

Especially, since the constitution of Jeju Special Self-Governing Province, the importance of council, a part of local government is growing. This study suggested operation improvement plan of secretariat of Jeju Special Self-governing Provincial Council as a research on HR management of Jeju Special Selfgoverning Provincial Council. First, there is a need to newly establishes series of classes of council in secretariat. The focus of the discussion is to set the basic direction to setting position classification system, not a rank system to establish subject and standard of classification. Second, there is a need to prepare a HR exchange plan among councils. HR exchange among councils is a measure to supplement establishment of series of classes of council, which should be conducted in regional wise regarding personnel administration. Third, there is a need to reinforce specialists. To reinforce legislative function of standing committee members and monitoring toward executive body, there is a need to upgrade the position of specialists who are currently bound at grade 4 government employee according to current law. Also, to improve professionalism of legislative activity, there is a need to separately establish a support system such as legislation researcher or communication support team to reinforce specialist group. Fourth, there is a need to reinforce support for legislative activity. There is a need to aggressively review on the reorganization of legislative policy manager office. Also, by categorizing its function as legislation and policy support task, it could conduct policy analysis and research analysis task required by the standing committee.

경쟁과 칸막이 위주의 NPM적 인적자원관리로는 더 이상 조직 내외의 난제해결, 행정수요의 충족, 행정서비스의 제공을 담보하기가 쉽지 않다. 글로벌 환경이 급변함에 따른 난제나 행정수요를 선제적이고 능동적으로 해결하기 위해서는 post-NPM 관점의 핵심인 협업을 구현할 수 있는 인적자원관리를 지향할 필요가 있다. 특히, 조직구성원들과 조직들에게 협업 친화적인 역량을 높여서 조직경계를 넘나드는 과제나 업무를 해결할 수 있도록 인적자원을 적재･적소･적시에 재배치할 필요가 있다. 이런 맥락에서 post-NPM 관점의 인력재배치와 부합할 수 있는 유동정원제, 통합정원제, 인사교류의 운영상 한계를 진단하고 이를 개선할 수 있는 방안을 제시한다.It is very important for any organization to reallocate right person at right place in proper time.

By so doing, this paper provides a starting ground from which five papers of the special forum may develop their respective arguments. First, the current paper submits that the paradigm shift in Korea should be re-examined not only from the perspective of domestic economic crisis, but also from a macro perspective in which the existing dominant management paradigm at the global level has been rapidly deinstitutionalized during the same period. That is, we argue that to understand the ongoing paradigm shift of Korean HR-organization management accurately, scholars must take into consideration the currently ongoing replacement of the traditional management paradigm based on the principles of mass production, efficiency, and system maximization, by a completely new paradigm focusing on continuous creative innovation at the global level. Second, this paper reviews the change of socio-psychological foundation underlying the paradigm shift in Korea. Since the 1997 financial crisis, the characteristics of Korean HR-organization management have shifted from long-term stable employment to flexible employment, from internal promotion to external labor market, from seniority principle to performance principle, and from collectivism to individualism. We argue that this shift was perceived as a serious violation of the existing psychological contract, which would seriously diminish employees’ organizational commitment and job satisfaction. In this respect, we stress that the greatest challenge of the 21st century Korean HR-organization management will be to find a creative way to rebuild a strong psychological contract with employees under the situation in which such goal is increasingly difficult to achieve. Third, this paper also reviews the change of leadership discourse in Korea during the period, since leaders play a pivotal role in paradigm shift. According to our comparison of dominant leadership discourse between global and Korean management fields during the last decade, Korean management field has still been strongly preoccupied with Neo-charismatic leadership models, while they have been significantly declined at the global level. Moreover, we also found that Korean field has not started yet to pay attention to the issue of leadership and creativity/innovation which is one of the most popular agenda at the global level during the past decade. We argue that this discrepancy in leadership discourse between Korean and global management fields during the period comes from Korea’s unique historical situation in which the entire society was preoccupied with the rapid deinstitutionalization of the conventional HR-organization management paradigm. After briefly introducing five papers published in this special forum, we call for continued attempts to make theoretical sense of the currently ongoing structural transformation of HR-organization management paradigm that has immensely and fundamentally affected lives of the entire Korean citizens as an imminent calling of all management scholars living in the early 21st century.HR/Organization Paradigm Shift, 21st Century Paradigm, Socio-Psychological Foundation, Leadership Models"

F검증을 통해 나타난 집단적 영향의 분석결과는 합리적 선택과 제도적 동형화 압력이 모두 통계적으로 유의한 영향을 미치고 있음을 보여주고 있다. 한편 영향요인들을 개별적 으로 살펴보면 합리적 선택 변수 중에서는 노동시장의 유연성 지각이, 그리고 제도적 동형화 요인 중에서는 외국인 지분율, 재벌계열사 여부가 혁신적 인사제도의 도입에 일관되게 정(+)의 영향을 미치고 있음을 보여주고 있고, 합리적 선택 변수 가운데 차별화 경영전략이 혁신적 인사제도의 도입에 부분적으로 정(+)의 영향을 미치는 것으로 나타나고 있다. 또한 혁신적 인사관리제도를 숙련형성 측면과 동기부여 측면으로 구분하여 각각에 대한 영향 요인을 살펴본 결과, 숙련향상보다 동기부여와 관련된 인사제도의 변화가 합리적 선택 관점과 제도적 동형화 요인 모두에 의해 더 잘 설명되고 있다. 이는 경제위기 이후 인사관리변화가 주로 동기부여 측면에 집중되어 이루어졌음을 시사한다.This study investigates empirically, from the perspectives of rational choice and institutional iso-morphism, the factors that has determined the adoption of innovative HR practices in Korea after the recent economic crisis. The hypotheses based on the rational choice perspective are as follows: high-road business strategy, the higher competition of product market, and the perceived higher flexibility of labor market will facilitate the adoption of innovative HR practices. On the other hand, the hypotheses based on the institutional iso-morphistic perspective are as follows: proximity to public sphere, the higher share by the foreigners, the enhanced role and the size of HR department, an affiliate of a conglomerate, and whether for CEO to get a degree at a foreign university will have a positive effect on the adoption of innovative HR practices. The empirical analysis is based on a survey data of 'Change in Environments and HRMs since the Economic Crisis' conducted by Korea Labor Institute in 2000. The results indicate that the overall effects of both rational choice and institutional iso-morphistic variables on HR innovations are significantly positive.

To test empirically hypotheses, the survey data on performance based HR changes, consisting of 120 companies all of which have been listed in Korea Stock Exchange(KSE) from 2001 to 2004, were gathered. The financial data of firm performance for the 3 years average after CEO succession were gathered. For financial statements of firms, KISLINE, a database maintained by Korea Investors Service Inc. was used. 

The results of this study can be summarized as follows; first, when CEOs are replaced for performance-related reasons, the likelihood of HR system change is not significantly higher than when the replacement is due to non-performance related reasons. Second, the appointment of an inside CEO rather than outside CEO accompanies significantly greater extent of performance-based HR system changes. Third, performance based HR system changes are associated with significantly positive to the 3 years average of industry-adjusted ROA changes.The objectives of this study are to examine performance-based HR system changes associated with CEO succession and to determine the relationship of HR system changes that explain firm performance.

이러한 관점에서 본 연구는 최근 한국 기업들이 도입하여 활용하고 있는 성과주의 인사제도가 전략적 인적자원관리의 보편론적 관점에서 기업이 처한 상황이나 문화에 관계없이 기업성과에 긍정적인 영향을 미치는지를 밝히고자 하였다. 아울러 전략적 인적자원관리의 상황론적 관점에서 최고경영자의 지원이 성과주의 인사제도의 활용 정도와 기업성과간의 관계를 어떻게 조절하는지 파악하고자 하였다.
연구결과, 성과주의 인사시스템과 기업성과간의 정(+)의 인과관계가 부분적으로 검증되었으나, 최고경영자 지원의 조절효과는 나타나지 않았다. 연구결과의 해석 및 시사점, 연구한계 등을 제시하였다.Since the currency crisis of 1997, Korean companies have, in order to restore their competitive advantage, rapidly discarded their traditional seniority-based HR practices and instead adopted performance-based HR practices. Even though there have been a plentiful body of research in the West confirming the positive relation between performance-based HR practices and firm performance, there have been few empirical studies done on whether the new systems have contributed to firm performance or not, in case of Korea.
This study demonstrates that the performance-based HR practices can help Korean companies enhance their firm performance even under local business conditions that are different from the western ones. In addition, it shows that CEO's support for the HRM department are critical factors in achieving its firm performance through successfully implementing performance-based HR practices.performance-based HR practice, CEO's support, firm performance"

Agency 이론 관점에서는 1) 모든 구성원들의 목표를 일치시키는 성과관리, 2) 전사의 성과를 공유하는 집단성과급제, 3) 투명한 정보의 공유, 4) 역할과 책임(R&R)을 명확히 하는 직무분석의 인사제도를 제시하였다. 또한 Stewardship 이론 관점에서는 1) 조직 가치와 부합하는 엄격한 선발전략, 2) 기업의 사회적 책임의 확대와 구체적인 실천, 3) 리더의 적극적 경청 및 쌍방향 커뮤니케이션, 4) 일과 삶의 의미를 일깨워주는 조직영성(Workplace Spirituality)의 인사제도 및 사례를 제시하였다.
본 연구에서는 두 이론 가운데 어느 한 쪽을 선택해야 하기 보다는 Agency 문제를 해결하기 위한 통제장치를 갖추고, 이 바탕 위에 Stewardship을 고취할 수 있는 인적자원관리를 도입하는 것을 이상적인 조직으로 가정하였다. 또한 Barrett(2003)의 의식수준 단계이론을 원용하여, 개인과 조직의 의식 수준에 따라 조직에서 제공하는 인사 관행들이 다르게 나타나야 하고, 향후 한국기업에서 구성원들이 가지고 있는 긍정적인 측면을 강화하는 제도의 도입 및 운영의 필요성을 강조하였다.This study draws on both agency theory and stewardship theory in order to develop a fuller understanding of the change in performance-based HR practice of Korean firms. It also suggests ideal HR practice for Korean firms based on case studies conducted in recent years. In terms of agency theory, the study suggests HR practices and cases including 1) performance management assures goal congruence of all employees, 2) gainsharing that enables knowledge sharing on collective increases in productivity, 3) transparent information sharing, and 4) job analysis that defines role and responsibilities. From a stewardship theory perspective, the study suggests the following HR practices and cases 1) strict recruitment strategy consistent with firm value, 2) an expansion of corporate social responsibility and concrete practice, 3) leader’s enthusiastic involvement and interactive communication, and 4) workplace spirituality that enlightens the meaning of work and life.
Rather than leaning towards one of these two theories, we suppose that the ideal HR practice is the one that retains control system to resolve agency problems and also inspires stewardship. By referring to Barrett’s (2003) seven level of consciousness model, this study asserts that different HR practices should be implemented according to the consciousness level of both individuals and organization. Lastly, the study emphasizes the importance of implementation and operation of system that empowers positive elements of employees.Agency theory, Stewardship theory, Performance-based HR practices and cases"

The results show that Job-based HR measured by the usage of job analysis has a positive effect on labor productivity(sales per employee), but ageing measured by the ratio of employees over 45 years old has a negative effect on productivity. The firm which heavily uses job analysis has 2.38 million won higher sales per employee compared to the firm which doesn't use job analysis at all when other conditions are equal. On the other hand, when the firm's ageing increases by 1%, the sales per employee decreases 1.34 million won when other conditions are equal. Additionally, Job-based HR has positive effects on productivity for the firms with both high and low proportion of older employees, but the positive impact of Job-based HR is significantly stronger at the firm with high proportion of older employees. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that Korean firms of which older employees have heavily increased need to introduce Job-based HR immediately.job-based HR, job analysis, ageing, labor productivity, participatory work practices"

To this end, the study selected properties of high-performance HR practices, cooperative industrial relations, and organizational performance on the basis of literature review. The study collected 317 questionnaires from employees of eight five-star hotels, and found that the sub-factors of high-performance HR practices – selective recruiting, result-oriented evaluation, and incentivized compensation – had a significant impact on cooperative industrial relations. Also, training, result-oriented evaluation, and cooperative industrial relations showed a significant effect on organizational performance. Verification of the mediating effect of cooperative industrial relations found that selective recruiting and incentivized compensation did not have a significant effect on organizational performance, but they did indirectly when cooperative industrial relations mediated. This means that since high-performance HR practices are rooted upon participatory management principles, cooperative relations between labor and management encourage the two parties to consult with each other on the proper size of recruitment or incentivized compensation, driving innovation and competitiveness of hotel companies. In the conclusion, the study presents the results, implications, and limitations of the research.High-performance HR practices, Cooperative industrial relations, Organizational performance, Hotels"

이러한 연구 배경을 토대로 본 연구에서는 직무중심 인사관리가 구성원 태도에 미치는 영향력을 실 증 분석하였다. 일의 의미와 직무열의, 개인-직무 적합성, 직무소진을 종속변수로 설정하고 직무중심 인사관리가 각각의 태도 변수들에 미치는 효과를 분석하였다. 가설 검증을 위해 다양한 산업에 있는 101개 기업의 자료를 수집하였다. 동일방법편의를 피하기 위해 기업 수준의 정보와 직무중심 인사관 리 문항은 인사담당자를 통해 측정하였고, 개인 수준 변수는 기업 내 구성원에게 측정하여 분석에 활용 하였다. 직무중심 인사관리와 구성원의 태도는 다수준 구조로 이루어져 있기 때문에 위계적 선형모형 (HLM)의 분석 방법을 사용하였다, 분석 결과, 직무중심 인사관리는 일의 의미, 직무열의, 개인-직무 적합성에 유의한 정의 효과를 미치는 것을 확인하였다. 그러나 직무소진에는 직무중심 인사관리의 유 의한 영향을 확인하지 못하였다.
분석 결과를 토대로, 결론에서는 본 연구가 갖는 이론적 시사점과 직무중심 인사관리의 현장 활용 방안 및 효과적인 운영을 위한 실무적 시사점을 제시하였으며 연구의 한계 및 향후 연구 방향을 제안 하였다.The recent management environment calls for a change in HR based on traditional seniority in Korean companies. Although the HR practice has advantages and disadvantages, Korean companies are suffering from various difficulties due to seniority-based HR. For example, there is an increase in high-position employees, problems of pay equity, lack of motivation, lack of professional training system, or side effects due to unfit of individuals and jobs in recruitment and placement. As an alternative, job-based HR is actively discussed. Job-based HR is based on systematic collection of job information and job evaluation. It refers to a HR system that manages all kinds of HR practices such as personnel planning, recruitment, evaluation, development, compensation, and turnover based on the contents and information of job. There are many arguments that the systematic and rational HR system based on job will be an alternative to the existing senior-based HR. However, the discussion so far has been lacking in empirical studies on the effects of job-based HR on Korean firms, as it is an exploratory study or a practical view.
Based on these backgrounds, this study empirically analyzed the impact of job-based HR on employee attitude. The meaning of work, job engagement, person-job fit, burnout were set as dependent variables. And we analyzed the effect of job-based HR on each attitude variable. In order to verify the hypothesis, we collected data from 101 companies in various industries. To avoid the common method bias, organizational level information and job-based HR items were measured through HR managers. Individual level variables were measured and analyzed by the members of the company. Because the job-based HR and employee attitudes are composed of multi-level structure, HLM analysis method is used. The results of the analysis show that job-based human resource management has a significant positive effect on work meaning, job engagement, and person-job fit. However, job-based human resource management did not have a significant effect on job burnout.
In conclusion, we suggested theoretical implications and practical implications for the practical utilization and successful operation of job-based human resource management. Furthermore, we discussed the limitations of this study and directions for future research.job-based HR, work meaning, job engagement, person-job fit, burnout"

BPMC, diazinon and fenitrothion may cause the inhibition to the biological process in sewage treatment plant and need to detect toxicity within short contact time. The ToxTemp method showed sensitive detection with more shorter contact of 1-1.5 hr time than that of the standard 48 hr acute bioassay. To evaluate toxicity of real wastewater/sewage, the inhibition rate of nitrification and oxygen uptake rate (OUR) using activated sludge, the standard 48hr acute bioassay and ToxTemp method using C. dubia were compared, respectively. On the basis of the inhibition rate of nitrification, the OUR test showed the less sensitive results at the relatively strong toxic sewage. On the other hands, the standard 48hr acute bioassay and ToxTemp method using C. dubia represented the toxicity of each wastewater/sewage with high sensitivity. Even the slightly low (about 1.5%) sensitivity, the ToxTemp method showed the high applicability to the real site of sewage treatment plant.Ceriodaphnia Dubia, Standard 48 hr Acute Bioassay, ToxTemp Method, Insecticide Toxicity, Sewage Toxicity"

이를 위해 삼성은 신인사 제도를 도입하여 지난 20년간 신경영 이념에 맞는 임직원의 마인드 및 역량 변화를 추구하여 왔다. 본 고에서는 신인사의 인사개혁을 다음과 같이 네 가지 영역으로 나누어 소개한다. 첫째는 핵심인재관리와 차세대 리더양성으로, 삼성이 초일류 기업으로 도약하기 위해 필수적인 투입 요소인 인재를 어떻게 확보하고 육성해왔는지를 소개한다.
다음으로는 열린 채용과 능력주의로 삼성이 순혈주의를 극복하고 다양한 창의적 인재를 확보하기 위해 어떠한 변화를 시도했는지를 살펴 본다. 셋째로 글로벌 우수 인재를 육성하기 위한 대표적인 제도인 지역전문가 제도와 글로벌전략그룹에 대해알아 본다. 마지막으로 삼성의 인재들을 동기부여하기 위한 보상과 승진에 있어서의 개혁에 대해 살펴 본다.
삼성 신인사의 특징은 크게 4가지로 정리할 수 있다. 첫째, 삼성에서는 인사가 전략을 지원하는 수준을 넘어 인사가 전략을 선도하기도 한다는 점에서 인사와 전략의 관계가 양방향 연계형이라는 점이다. 둘째, 인사를 통해 스피드, 실행력, 혁신력과 같은 조직역량을 향상시킴으로서 경쟁기업을 넘어서는 성과를 이루어냈다는 점이다. 셋째, 일본식 인사제도에서출발한 삼성은 미국식 인사를 적절히 도입하여 일본식과 미국식이 결합된 융합형 인사시스템을 구축하였다. 마지막으로,삼성의 신인사는 일본식 경영에서 벗어나지 못하던 한국 사회에 성공적 변화 사례를 제공하여 사회의 각 분야에서 자신있게 고비용 저효율 제도를 철폐하고 새로운 가치관과 경영 방식에 과감히 도전할 수 있도록 도왔다는 점에서 매우 중요한기여를 하였다. 즉, 한국 사회 전반에 세계 수준에 이를 수 있다는 자신감과 역량의 향상을 불러 일으키면서 한국 기업과사회가 한층 더 향상되는데 기여했다는 점에서 변혁적 리더십을 발휘했다고 할 수 있다.The rise of Samsung from a mediocre, low-cost manufacturer to one of the biggest and themost competitive global giants has drawn attention from both the business circles and academia.
Samsung is a conglomerate (called chaebol in Korea), which was founded by Byung Chul Leein 1938. The current chairman of Samsung is Kun-hee Lee. The Samsung group include SamsungElectronics (the world's largest information technology company measured by 2012 revenues,and 4th in market value), Samsung Heavy Industries (the world's 2nd-largest shipbuildermeasured by 2010 revenues), and Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T (respectively theworld's 13th and 36th-largest construction companies). Other notable subsidiaries includeSamsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th-largest life insurance company), Samsung Everland(operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea), Samsung Techwin (anaerospace, surveillance and defense company) and Cheil Worldwide (the world's 16th-largestadvertising agency measured by 2011 revenues).
Remarkable growth of Samsung in the last two decades was sparked by the New Managementinitiative proclaimed by Chairman Kun-hee Lee in 1993. It called for complete changes inemployees' attitudes and competency so Samsung could transform itself from a small Koreanmanufacturer to a globally respected company. To facilitate this transformation, Samsungembarked on New HR (human resources) initiatives. In this study, we explain four key areasthat went through fundamental changes under the New HR initiative. First, Samsung introducedcore talent management programs and a series of systematic programs to develop next-generationleaders, which played pivotal roles for the success of Samsung by providing talents who led Samsung's rise in the global markets. Second, Samsung emphasized performance-based HRinstead of deeply-entrenched seniority-based HR. Also Samsung discarded age-old tradition ofpure-blood HR principles and actively recruited outsiders and diverse group of employees thatincluded females, non-conformist talents, handicapped people, etc. Third, Samsung began tomake bold investments to develop global talents by starting the Regional Specialists programand the Global Strategy Group. Finally, Samsung introduced performance-based compensationand promotion policies that provided strong motivation for higher performance.
The effects of New HR were remarkable. It allowed Samsung to secure precious human,social, and organizational capital with which Samsung eventually became one of the biggestconglomerates in the world. The characteristics of Samsung's New HR are as follows. First,Samsung's HR not only supports strategy but also leads strategy by proactively securing anddeveloping talents. Second, Samsung's HR enhanced organizational competencies such as speed,innovation, and execution which proved to be crucial competencies that propelled Samsung'srise in the competitive global markets. Third, Samsung created an HR systems that combinesstrengths of both Japanese and American HR systems. Finally, Samsung's HR helped Koreanbusiness and society in general to shed off age-old Japanese-style management systems thatwere too slow and seniority-oriented. Samsung's New HR could be called a transformationalleader in Korea in that it helped the society to make transformations to a more performancebasedone.Samsung, New HR, New Management, Globalization, Korea"

첫째, 법률 규정을 회피하는 수단으로 협약을 남용함으로써 법률 우위원칙에 위배되고 법령체계의 혼란을 초래한다. 둘째, 협약의 효력은 당사자에게만 미치므로 동일한 직위에 대하여 지방자치단체장과 지방의회의 구성이 변경되면 임명기준과 절차가 달라질 수 있다. 셋째, 동일하거나 유사한 지방공기업 사장에 협약의 체결 유무에 따라 지방자치단체별로 임명절차가 달라진다. 넷째, 대법원에서 판결한 바와 같이 단체장의 인사권을 지방의회가 과도하게 제약한다.
이를 해결하기 위한 가장 바람직한 적법절차는 두말할 것도 없이 국회에서 인사청문회 실시 근거 법률을 제정하는 것이지만, 그 이전이라도 지방자치단체가 조례로 법인격을 부여(설립)한 지방공기업 등에 대하여 지방의회가 청문회에서 후보자의 적격성 여부를 말로써 지적할 것이 아니라 단체장의 인사권 행사기준이 될 공기업사장의 자격이나 능력요건 또는 고위 공직자로 임명해서는 안 될 결격사유를 조례로 정하는 것이 자치입법권을 올바르게 행사하는 방법이 될 것이다.In some metropolitan municipalities of local government, provincial councils are conducting HR hearings before the appointment of local government-owned enterprises’ CEOs by signing “conventions” with provincial governor or mayor. Unlike private companies, where the autonomous principle is dominant, there are the following legal problems in the public institutions where the rule of law should be adapted.
First, by abusing the convention as a means of avoiding legal provisions, it violates the principle of supremacy and causes confusion in the statutory system. Second, since the effect of the convention is limited only to the parties, the appointment criteria and procedures are different according to the composition of the heads of the local governments and the local councils for the same positions. Third, the procedures for appointment of local autonomous entities vary depending on whether or not they have made agreements with the heads of the same or similar local public enterprises. Fourth, just like the Supreme Court cases, local council has excessive restrictions on the governor’s right without legal grounds.
The most appropriate due process for solving this is to enact the laws on the basis of the execution of the HR hearings in the National Assembly. However, it is a proper way for the local councils, as a basis for the exercise of the appointment right, to make rules of establishing certain qualifications or capability standards for the CEO’s of relevant institutions or by determining the disqualifications not to be appointed as a senior official.Local government, HR hearings, Provincial council, Convention, Rule of law, National Assembly."

This study develops the theoretical model, drawing upon the theories of the informal HR practices in the small enterprises. The statistical models of this study are dynamic panel-data models whose dependent variables are sales per capita and operating income per capita. Their main independent variables are the indicator of innovative HR practices across five HR functions such as work organization, training, performance appraisals, pay system, and pay level.
The outcomes of the regression analyses indicate that the total score of the innovative HR practices do not have significant effects on sale per capita, but significantly negative effects on operating income per capita. By HR functions, innovate work organization, innovative pay system, and pay level have negative effects on operating income per capita. On the other hand, there is no innovative HR indicator which is identified to influence labor productivity positively. Finally the results are summarized, and policy implications are discussed.Personnel Management in Small Enterprises, Informal HR practices, Innovative HR Practices, Firm Performance Effect, Dynamic Panel Model"

Previous research has focused on how social responsibility has impacted on the company's social performance and economic performance, and dealt with the relationship between social responsibility and human resource effectiveness. However, there are few studies on how to implement corporate social responsibility in human resources management functions. This study reviews the social responsibility activities that can be performed by human resource managers. Public institutions are required to practice social equity from the government, centered on social equity employment. However, public institutions are having difficulty in how to implement social equity human resources because social equity HR is not a concept that has been dealt with sufficiently in academic fields . This study distinguishes the concepts and types of social equity HR and suggests four social equity HR strategies that can be used by public organizations.

Therefore, in order to explicate a management system of organizations based on intangible assets, we pursue to HR system of knowledge intensive organizations, which is measured by empirically developed knowledge intensiveness of work in organizations. Empirical results are as follows: First, the HLM analysis shows that there was statistically significant variation in the mean of knowledge intensiveness, and in the slopes of collaboration of work across organizations when regressed on gender, age, education and career in each organization. Second, the next step in the HLM analysis shows that the impact of human resource system characteristics on the levels of work collaboration was stronger in organizations with flexible work system, organic compensation system and activity based development sytem. These results imply, first, it is necessary to focus on work collaboration in knowledge intensive work, in order to more parsimonious scale of knowledge intensity. Second, it must be supported by compensation strategy based Burns & Stalker(1961)'s organic theory, and organic compensation system must be supported by culture, HRM systems included on employee selection system, career development, and so on, in order to elevate knowledge intensiveness in organization. Therefore further research will be necessary to multi-level analysis of relationship among knowledge intensiveness, employee attitudes at individual focus and HR systems at organizational focus.Expertise, Knowledge intensive organization, Knowledge intensive work, Knowledge intensiveness, Multilevel analysis"

본 연구에서는 선행연구를 바탕으로 기업시민행동의 개념을 명확히 하고자 했으며, 인적자원성과와 주관적 재무성과, 일인당 매출액을 각각 매개변수와 종속변수로 선정하여 횡단적 회귀분석을 실시하였고, 이를 통해서 기업시민행동이 기업성과에 미치는 영향을 실증적으로 검증하였다. 실증분석 결과 기업시민행동은 인적자원성과, 주관적 재무성과, 일인당 매출액에 긍정적인 영향을 미치는 것으로 나타났으며, 인적자원성과는 기업시민행동과 주관적 재무성과의 관계를 완전매개 하는 것으로 확인됐다. 그리고 기업시민행동과 일인당 매출액의 관계에서는 인적자원성과의 매개 역할을 확인할 수 없었고, 기업시민행동의 직접효과만을 확인할 수 있었다. 즉, 국내의 기업이 추구하는 기업시민행동이 인적자원성과와 기업성과를 향상시키는 것을 확인한 것이다. 그리고 인적자원성과의 매개 역할을 부분적으로 확인함으로써, 기업시민행동과 기업성과의 연결고리 일부를 밝혔다.This article examines the effect of the Corporate Citizenship Behavior(CCB) on HR outcomes and firm performance.

Specifically, we will pay attention to the double-sideness of the rationalization of the HR systems in the organization. And we examine whether the efforts of the organization to pursue the rationality of the HR system lead to substantial rational results. To analyze whether this organizational characteristics reduces or increases the gender pay gap, we pay attention to the formalization of HR system, the transparency of HR system, and the pay-for-performance. The data is obtained from 110 companies and 1,129 managers using the 2nd(2008) and 3rd(2010) data of <Korean Women Manager Panel> and the results are as follows.
First, there is gender pay gap between men and women working in the same workplace. Specifically, it has been confirmed that women’s salaries are about 3% lower than men’s, even though it controls the positions, education levels, working hours, and tenures of men and women working together in the same organization.
Second, the formalization of the HR systems is not related to gender pay gap.
Third, the transparency of the HR system does not lowers the wage of women but increases men’s contrary to hypothesis. Fourth, the pay-for-performance increases gender pay gap. The pay-for-performance wage systems appears to be more beneficial for men than for women, confirming that more compensation was being made for men, even if women and men had similar work performance.gender pay gap, HR rationalization, female manager, multilevel analysis"

He emphasizes the importance of innovation and emphasizes that innovation is the only true formula, not just a trend of management. This innovation is of great importance for securing competitive advantage, sustainable growth. However, despite these importance, studies on what are the psychological leading factors leading to innovation behavior and how it is created are insufficient. In addition, in order to generate corporate profits, diverse career development of employees and their positive and positive organizational behavior are required. This organizational behavior is positive psychological capital. Individual-level innovation behavior is influenced by various channels such as corporate culture and leader support. With this in mind, this study empirically analyzed the impact on innovation behavior of corporate personnel in charge of the sub-dimension of positive psychological capital, which is the main competency of the individual level. And the mediator effect was verified assuming that the personnel manager's positive psychological capital would go through the self-directed learning phase leading to voluntary learning attitudes before inducing innovative behavior. The result has a significant impact on self-directed learning as a result of the positive psychological capital of HR managers, while self-directed learning is a leading variable of innovative behavior. In self-directed learning, the mediating role between two variables was verified. The results of this study proved that the result of positive psychological capital was self-directed learning. In addition, it can be seen that self-directed learning ability is a major variable of innovative behavior. Based on the research results, practical suggestions were made.Positive Psychological Capital, Innovation behavior, Self-directed learning, Individual-level, HR Manager"

However, most of the available methods involve expensive instrumentations such as HRGC-HRMS or ECNI-LRMS, apart from expensive extraction and clean-up (with large volume of solvents) steps. A method has been devised combining the analytical separation power of PYE [2-(1-pyrenyl)ethyldimethysilylated silica] column HPLC and high-resolution gas chromatographic techniques including micro-electron capture detection (ECD) and two dimensional gas chromatograpy-ECD techniques to determine these eco-toxic substances at parts-per-trillion (ppt) levels. This combination resolves co-elution of congeners that occur in disproportionate ratios (e.g. CB-110 and -77) and allows accurate congener-specific determination of target compounds. This method is cost effective as it requires only hexane, that in small quantities (10 mL) and GC-ECD. The elution and analysis time are optimized to less man hours. This method is effectively utilized in the analysis of co-planar PCBs and PBDEs from archived solvent extracts of samples previously analyzed for pesticides and PCBs.

Kearney (2012), India is the 5th mostattractive retail destination in the world. The retail industryin India has been largely fragmented with small businessesdominating the retail landscape, with very few large playershaving multiple retail outlets. However, in the last few years,the industry has witnessed a significant growth in the numberof large retailers having a chain of outlets across the country. This growth in the organised retail sector has driven primarilyby large Indian retail organisations and conglomerates. With the government reducing the restrictions on foreignparticipation in Indian retail business by increasing the FDIcap on both single and multi-brand retail outlets, the industryis likely to see an explosive growth in the organised retailsector which accounts for only 8 percent of the total industry. With more foreign retailers poised to enter into the country,one of the key issues that the industry may face is findingthe right quality of manpower. Literature suggests that in anindustry which is characterised by players offering similarkinds of product assortments at similar price levels, successwould be governed by the quality of service, which entailsemployees having the right skills and attitudes for offeringquality service. Therefore, the two key issues that may be ofimportance for retailers are levels of skills and the motivationof the employees. However, according to the NationalSkill Development Corporation (NSDC, 2009), a significantskill gap exists in the industry, which may widen further inthe years ahead, leading to greater challenges for organisations. This paper highlights some of the challenges and issues which characterise the industry in India, and suggests howcompanies could look at these challenges and seek ways toovercome these challenges."

However, despite this importance, structural studies on various situational factors and mediating factors regarding coaching leadership and psychology are insufficient. In addition, the research on the individual level of HR manager, which is known to be a major variable between human resource management and organizational performance, is even less. Therefore, this paper examines the effects of the coaching leadership of leaders on innovative behavior of HR managers. In addition, by examining the mediating effects of positive psychological capital and organizational commitment, the objective of this paper is to empirically verify the influence of these variables on innovative behavior of HR manager. The results of the empirical analysis were as follows: First, the relationship between coaching leadership and innovative behavior of HR manager, positive psychological capital, and organizational commitment was mostly positive. Second, positive psychological capital had a positive influence on organizational commitment and innovative behavior. Third, organizational commitment and positive psychological capital had partial mediating effects.Coaching leadership, Innovative Behavior, Positive Psychological Capital, Organizational Commitment, HR Manager"

공영방송의 기능수행에서 수신료 재정은 절대적인 의미를 갖는다. 수신료 재정은 공영방송의 기능수행을 위한 프로그램 자치권과 독립성 확보를 위한 기본적 전제이기 때문이다. 이러한 수신료의 중요성을 고려하여, 입법자가 수신료결정을 할 때 일반의 방송정책과 구분해서 판단해야 한다. 그렇지 않으면 입법자가, 수신료결정에 일반적인 방송정책을 관련시켜서, 공영방송에 대해서 부당하게 개입할 여지가 있다. 그 경우 공영방송의 기능과 독립성에 심각한 영향을 줄 수 있기 때문이다. 헌법적 근거를 갖는 공영방송의 수신료에 대한 정치권의 불합리한 규제는, 공영방송의 기능을 무력화시키게 된다. 따라서 독일의 판례에 나타난 바와 같이, 우리도 수신료결정절차를 합리화하여 전문화할 필요가 있다. 그것이 공영방송의 기능수행을 위한 최선의 방안이기도 하다. 종래 입법자에게 전권이 주어졌던 수신료결정 절차를, 전문적인 위원회가 참여하는 협동적절차로 단계화하는 것이다. 즉 공영방송이 계획한 프로그램을 기초로 신고한 재정수요를, 전문기관이 심사하고, 그 결과를 입법자가 수신료결정의 판단 자료로 삼도록 하는, 수신료결정과정에서의 협동절차가 필요하다. 이는 기존의 정치적인 수신료결정절차를 전문화된 결정절차로 전환하는 것으로서, 궁극적으로 공영방송의 원활한 기능수행을 위한 독립성 보장에 기여할 수 있게 된다.Die Rundfunkfreiheit dient der freien, individuellen und öffentlichen Meinungsbild- ung und ist demnach auch eine Grundvoraussetzung für eine funktionsfähige Demo- kratie. Hier ist die Rundfunkfreiheit als dienende Freiheit zu verstehen. Die Rundfunk- freiheit gebietet auch die Schaffung einer positiven Ordnung, die die Meinungsvielfalt gewährleistet und sicherstellt, daß der Rundfunk einzelnen gesellschaftlichen Gruppen oder gar einer einzigen gesellschaftlichen Gruppe ebenso wenig wie dem Staat ausgeliefert wird. Auf der einen Seite soll die Rundfunkveranstaltung also durch öffentlich-rechtliche Anstalten autonom, also staatsfern erfolgen. Auf der anderen Seite ist der Staat gehalten, durch die Schaffung einer positiven Ordnung, also durch Rechtsnormen, gerade diese Staatsfreiheit sicherzrstellen. Die dienende Funktion der Rundfunkfreiheit ist darauf ausgerichtet, dem Bürger eine umfassende und ausgewogene Information zu sichern. Damit sichert diese Konzeption die Informationsfreiheit des Bürgers und letztlich auch die Funktionsfähigkeit der Demokratie.
Nach dieser Ansicht ist verfassungsrechtliches Ziel der Rundfunkfreiheit die Gewähr- leistung von Zugangschancen der Nutzer zu für die öffentliche und individuelle Meinungsbildung relevanten Informationen. Nämlich Rundfunkfreiheit schützt den Pro- zess öffentlicher Kommunikation vor freiheitswidrigen Restriktionen. Die Wirkungen des Fernsehens, sowohl dessen Suggestivkraft als auch dessen Breitenwirkung, gewinnen durch die neuen Technologien sogar zusätzliches Gewicht vor dem Hintergurnd der Digitalisierung und Konvergenz. Mit den neuen Techniken, wie Online-Dienste, nimmt zudem die Möglichkeiten zu, Einfluß auf die Rezipienten zu nehmen. Der Rund- funkbegriff ist daher dynamisch zu verstehen. Würde die Rundfunkfreiheit nur den klassischen Rundfunk erfassen, bestünde wie oben gesagt die Gefahr, daß bei einer Weiterentwicklung des Medienszstems das Ziel freier öffentlicher und individueller Meinungsbildung verfehlt würde. Auch Online-Dienste öffentlich-rechtlicher Rundfunk- anstalten dienen kommunkkativen Zielen der Rundfunkfreiheit. Damit sind Online- Dienste des öffentlichen Rundfunks als Rundfunk im Sinne der Rundfunkfreiheit anzusehen.
Die verfassungsrechtliche Gewährleistung der Rundfunkfreiheit erstreckt sich auch auf die finanziellen Bedingungen, von denen es abhängt, ob der öffentlich-rechtliche Rundfunk den Aufgaben nachkommen kann, die ihm von Verfassungswegen obliegen. Rundfunkfreiheit verpflichtet den Gesetzgeber, für eine aus reichende Finanzierung des verfassungsrechtliche geschützten Programmangebots zu sorgen. So müß das Gebühren- festsetzungsverfahren dem Gebot der Programmneutralität entsprechen. Auch darf es insgesamt nicht zu medienpolitischen Zwecken, insbesondere solchen der Programm- lenkung mißbraucht werden. Deshalb unterliegen Medienpolitik und gebührenfestsetzung einem verfassungsrechtlichen Trennungs gebot. Dafür hat das Karlsruher Gebührenurteil vom 11. 9. 2007 auf die Grundsätze des bestehenden dreistufigen kooperativen Verfahrens zur Festsetzung der Rundfunk gebühren zurückgreifen. Die Gebührenentsch -eidung muß an der Bedarfsanmeldung der Rundfunkanstalten anknüpfen. Dies beruht darauf, daß der Finanzausstattung die Programmentscheidungen der Rundfunkanstalten zugrunde zu legen sind. Auf der zweiten Stufe des Gebührenfestsetzungsverfahrens ist eine Überprüfung der Bedarfsanmeldungen grundsätzlich möglich und geboten. Bei dieser Kontrolle handelt es sich also nicht um eine politische, sondern um eine fachliche Aufgabe. Daher hat die Kontrolle durch ein Fachgremium stattzufinden. Auf der dritten Stufe ist die Gebührenentscheidung nach Maßgabe dieses überprüften Finanzbedarfs zu treffen. Die Festsetzung der Rundfunkgebühr muß frei von medienpolitischen Zweck setzungen erfolgen.Unabhängigkeit des öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunks, Gebührenfestsetzungsverfahren, Rundfunkgebühr, Entwicklungsgarantie für den öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunk, Online-Dienste des öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunks."

연구결과, 강압적 동형화와 모방적 동형화는 각각 기업의 CSR 추진과 몰입형 인사시스템에 영향을 미치고 있음을 알 수 있었다. 또한, 제도적 동형화와 몰입형 인사시스템 사이의 관계에서 CSR 추진이 부분 혹은 완전매개효과가 있음이 드러났다. 본 연구는 기업의 외부 환경이 서로 별개의 영역으로 간주될 수 있는 CSR 추진활동과 특정 인사시스템의 도입에 중요한 의미가 있음을 설명해주고 있다.Human Resource is important asset to companies’ sustainable competitiveness. The Commitment-based HR system is accepted by many companies as a personnel system that can maximize the capacity of these human resources. There are various factors influencing the commitment-based HR system, but this study examines how the pressure on institutional isomorphism affects the introduction of the HR system. In particular, we will focus on the mediating role of CSR promotion activities in this process. In other words, institutional isomorphism influences corporate CSR promotion activities and focuses on relationships that affect the commitment-based HR system. For the purpose of analyzing these relationships, we conducted a hypothesis test for the 419 companies included in the 2011 Korea Labor Institute’s “Workplace Panel Survey”.
The results of this study show that coercive isomorphism and mimetic isomorphism affect corporate CSR promotion and commitment-based HR system, respectively. In addition, the relationship between institutional isomorphism and commitment-based HR systems revealed that CSR promotion is partly or completely mediated. This study explains that there are significant implications for the introduction of CSR promotion activities and specific personnel systems, which can be regarded as separate areas of the company’s external environment.commitment-based HR system, CSR, coercive isomorphism, nor- mative isomorphism, mimetic isomorphism"
178,인사담당자의 심리적 안전감이 혁신행동에 미치는 영향 : 긍정심리자본의 조절효과,이가현 /Gahyun Lee,2018,대한경영학회,"최근 기업의 경쟁우위 확보를 위한 조직 경쟁력의 원동력으로서 인적자원관리의 중요성이 확대되고 있다.
이에, 인적자원관리의 주체인 인사담당자를 중심으로 조직행동 관점에서 접근해 볼 필요가 있는데, 선행연구에서는 심리적 안전감과 혁신행동과의 긍정적인 영향력에 관한 관계가 제시되었고, 효과적인 팀 리더는 개인이자신의 의견을 표현하는데 어려움을 겪지 않을 때 안전하다는 심리적 믿음을 형성함으로서 학습행동을 촉진하고 혁신행동을 장려한다고 하였다. 이러한 시사점들은 인사제도를 기획, 운영 및 실행을 통해 조직역량향상을가져오는 인사담당자의 심리적 안전감이 혁신성과에 미치는 영향의 중요성과 연계하여 볼 수 있으나, 이에대한 국내의 연구는 많지 않다. 따라서 본 연구는 지금까지 선행연구가 부족한 분야인 인사담당자의 심리적안전감이 혁신행동에 어떠한 영향을 미치는지를 연구하고자 하였다. 그리고 긍정심리자본이 인사담당자의심리적 안전감과 혁신행동 사이의 조절역할도 함께 연구하고자 하였다.
설정된 연구모형과 가설 검증을 위해 전국 시/도별 중소기업 정보에 게재된 중소기업 및 국내 100대 기업의인사담당자 394명을 대상으로 전화와 이메일을 통해 실증분석을 실시하였다.
연구 결과를 살펴보면, 인사담당자의 심리적 안정감을 독립변수로, 혁신행동을 종속변수로 한 단순회귀분석을 실시한 결과, 인사담당자의 심리적 안전감은 혁신행동에 정(+)의 영향을 미치는 데, 이는 인사담당자의심리적 안전감이 높을수록 혁신행동도 높아지는 것으로 나타났다.
또한, 긍정심리자본의 조절효과는 3단계 위계적 회귀분석을 통해 검증하였는데, 그 결과 인사담당자의 심리적 안전감은 자기효능감, 희망, 낙관적, 복원력의 상호작용에 유의한 영향을 미치는 것으로 나타났다.
본 연구의 시사점으로는 첫 번째, 인사담당자의 심리적 안전감을 독립변수로 하는 인적자원 기능 관점(HR function perspective)에 있어 개인수준(individual-level)의 분석을 시도했다는 점이다.
두 번째는 각 변수들을 독립적으로 보는 것이 아니라 이를 사회적 관계의 질이라는 포괄적인 개념의 관계(relationship)차원으로 개념화하였다.Recently, the importance of human resource management has been increasing as the driving force of organizational competitiveness for securing competitive advantage of companies.
Therefore, it is necessary to approach from the viewpoint of organizational behavior centering on the HR manager who is the subject of human resource management. In the preceding research, the relationship between the psychological safety sense and the positive influence of innovation behavior is suggested. And to encourage learning behavior and encourage innovation behavior by forming a psychological belief that it is safe when there is no difficulty in expressing their opinions.
In addition, it is the people that global executives profess to be the key to the survival of a company in a rapidly changing global competition. In other words, it emphasizes that the members of the organization are forced to rely on positive efforts and motivation. It suggests the importance of the careful organizational atmosphere of the organization members when presenting directions and asking questions about their work, reporting sometimes wrong information, and presenting innovative ideas. If the organizational climate criticizes and negatively assesses new ideas, this leads to anxiety, which prevents future expressions of their opinions and expanding activities. This negative experience of members of the organization is an obstacle to innovation behavior. Recent discussions on innovation focus on innovative behavior, including action. The foundation of innovation is an idea. Based on emotional intelligence, these ideas are developed and practiced, suggesting the importance of studying something that motivates and practices individuals' innovative behavior have. It is also noteworthy that the implications of innovation behavior in combination with the propensity to innovate and the environmental factors of individual members.
These implications can be seen in connection with the importance of the psychological safety sense of the HR manager who brings up the organizational capacity through the planning, operation and execution of the personnel system, but there are not many domestic studies on this.
In other words, empirical studies are needed to examine how the level of competency of human resource managers affects the effectiveness of human resource management and how it ultimately affects the innovation behavior that affects firm's financial performance.
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the psychological safety of HR managers with previous research being lacking on such aspect until now as well as how the derived impact influences on innovation behavior. Also, moderating effect of positive psychological capital between the psychological safety of the HR manager and innovative behavior is also studied. An empirical analysis was conducted through telemarketing and e-mail for 394 HR managers.
As a result of the study, the results of the simple regression analysis of psychological safety of the HR manager as the independent variable and the innovation behavior as the dependent variable showed that the psychological safety of the HR manager had a positive effect on the innovation behavior, The higher the psychological safety of HR managers in charge, the higher the innovation behavior.
In addition, the moderating effect of positive psychological capital was verified through three - step hierarchical regression analysis. As a result, psychological security of the HR manager had a significant influence on interaction of self - efficacy, hope, optimistic, and resilience.
The implications of this study are as follow: Firstly, I tried to analyze the individual-level of the HR function perspective with the psychological safety of the HR manager as the independent variable. The second is to conceptualize each variable as a relationship of a comprehensive concept of quality of social relations, rather than as an independent one. Therefore, it is necessary to approach the positive approach which takes into consideration the relationship dimension that can enhance the satisfaction of HR manager and the employee in the process of introducing the corporate plan.Psychological safety, Innovation behavior, Positive psychological capital, Individual-level, Positive organization scholarship"

181,Characterization of the Effects of Silver Nanoparticles on Liver Cell Using HR-MAS NMR Spectroscopy,Siwon Kim,2011,대한화학회,"AgNPs (silver nanoparticles) has been widely used for the commercial products, which have antimicrobial agent, medical devices, food industry and cosmetics. Despite, AgNPs have been reported as toxic to the mammalian cell, lung, liver, brain and other organs and many researchers have investigated the toxicity of AgNPs. In this study, we investigated toxicity of the AgNPs to the liver cell using metabolomics based on HRMAS NMR (High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) technics, which could apply to the intact tissues or cells, to avoid the sample destruction. Target profiling and multivariative statistical analysis were performed to analyze the 1D ^1H spectrum. The results show that the concentrations of many metabolites were affected by the AgNPs in the liver cell. The concentrations of glutathione (GSH), lactate,taurine, and glycine were decreased and most of amino acids, choline analogues, and pyruvate were increased by the AgNPs. Moreover, the levels of the metabolites were recovered upto similar level of metabolites in the normal cell by the pre-treatment of NAC, external antioxidant. The results suggest that the depletion of the GSH by the AgNPs might induce the conversion of lactate and taurine to the pyruvate."

While extant research on social capital primarily focuses on the effects of social capital on its outcome variables, such as knowledge creation, innovation, and organizational performance, this study explores the antecedents of social capital. This paper developed and tested the hypotheses that commitment-based HR practices affect the three dimensions (structural, relational, and cognitive dimension) of social capital. A field study of the R&D divisions in knowledge-intensive firms showed that HR practices were positively associated with trust in coworkers and shared goals and values. These results indicate that HR practices play a critical role in creating and developing social capital. Based on the findings, the implications of the study are discussed and future research directions are suggested.HR practices, Social Capital, Social Interactions, Trust in Coworkers, Shared Goals and Values"

Moreover, this study investigates how a union and a HR department's power moderate the relationship between industrial relations and the implementation of HPWSs. To test our hypotheses, we used HCCP data from Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training. The results showed that hostile industrial relations negatively influenced the degree of HPWSs implementation. In addition, a HR department's power strengthened the negative relationship between hostile industrial relations and the implementation of HPWSs. On the contrary, a union's power attenuated the negative relationship between hostile industrial relations and the implementation of HPWSs, yet it was not statistically significant. In conclusion, this study has several implications for HR and IR research. From theoretical aspects, this study examines the effects of the quality of industrial relations and stakeholders' power when HPWSs are implemented. Also, from a practical standpoint, this study stressed that firms should pay attention to the improvement of industrial relations and the increase in a HR department's power in oder to carry out successfully HPWSs.High-Performance Work System, Industrial relations, Union, HR department, Power"

Existing studies proposed that succession planning can positively influence on organizational performance. We explained how succession planning can be related to organizational innovativeness, and tested our hypotheses from the Human Capital Corporate Panel data provided by KRIVET. The results indicated that succession planning had a positive impact on organizational innovativeness. Organizational trust mediated the relationship between succession planning and organizational innovativeness. In addition, we found that the relationship between succession planning and organizational innovativeness was mediated by organizational trust and the link between HR planning and business strategy. Sucession planning can enhance organizational trust, which further mediates the relationship between succession planning and organizational innovativeness. Stable and predictable human resource planning based on sucession planning can enhace the link between HR planning and business strategy, which also mediates the relationship between succession planning and organizational innovativeness. Findings suggest that benefits of succession planning are not limited to immediate performance improvement, but can also bring sustained growth and development.succession planning, theory of planned behavior, organization innovation, organizational trust, the link between HR planning and business strategy"

Thus, drawing on the “process” perspective of the HR implementation, the purpose of this study is to explore the mediating role of a HR department's activities in the positive relationship between HPWSs and employees' attitudes. In order to test our predictions, this study used 2009 Human Capital Corporate Panel(HCCP) data and the analytic results of 471 firms showed that a HR activities partially mediated the relationship between HPWSs and employees' attitudes such as job satisfaction and organizational commitment. These findings revealed that HPWSs per se positively influenced the increases in employees' job satisfaction and organizational commitment, but how a HR department delivers practices also contributed to fulfilling the intended effectiveness of HPWSs. In this respect, this study provides theoretical and practical implications for how a HR department effectively delivers designed HR practices to employees.High-performance Work system, HR Activities, Job Satisfaction, Organizational Commitment"

유식논서에서 참․괴를 설명한 내용을 간단하게 요약하자면 다음과 같다. 참․괴란 둘 다 부끄러워하는 마음작용이다. 하지만 참의 본질적인 성질은 자신의 힘[자증상]과 진리의 힘[법증상]에 비추어 스스로 부끄러워하는 것이고, 괴의 본질적인 성질은 타인의 시선이나 평판, 즉 세증상에 비추어 부끄러워하는 것이다. 다시 말해 참은 내면[자율]적인 부끄러움이고, 괴는 외면[타율]적인 부끄러움이다. 그리고 그 작용은 악행을 방지하는 것이라고 정의한다.
한편 인간은 부끄러워하는 마음작용인 참․괴도 있지만, 악행을 행할 때 부끄러워하지 않는 무참․무괴의 번뇌도 언제나 함께 작용한다. 그래서 참․괴를 보다 잘 이해하기 위해 그 반대 작용인 무참․무괴에 대해 살펴보았다. 참․괴와 무참․무괴는 제로섬 관계이다. 왜냐하면 선한 마음작용인 참․괴가 활동하면 무참․무괴는 사라진다. 반면 번뇌심소인 무참․무괴가 활동하면 참․괴는 사라지기 때문이다.This paper examines the essential nature of hrī․apatrāpya-caitta and its ancillary action among kuśala-caitta. To this end, the writer looked at the definition and commentary on hrī․apatrāpya-caitta in the Literature of Vijñaptimātra.
To summarize the description of hrī․apatrāpya in Literature of Vijñaptimātra: hrī․apatrāpya are both shy caitta. However, the essential nature of hrī is to be ashamed of itself in the light of sva-adhipati and dharma-dhipati, and the essential property of apatrāpya is to be ashamed in the light of another's gaze or reputation, that is, loka-adhipati. In other words, hrī is an inner[autonomous] shame, and apatrāpya is an outer[batting] shame. And its action is defined as preventing evil.
And while humans are ashamed of hrī․apatrāpya-caitta, ahrī․anapatrāpya's kleśa always works together. So, to understand hrī․apatrāpya better, we looked at the opposite, ahrī․anapatrāpya. hrī․apatrāpya and ahrī․anapatrāpya are zero-sum relationships. Because when the hrī․apatrāpya of kuśala-caitta is active, ahrī․anapatrāpya disappears. On the other hand, when ahrī․anapatrāpya of kleśa-caitta is active, hrī․apatrāpya disappears.hrī, apatrāpya, ahrī, anapatrāpya, adhipati"

In order to achieve the purpose of this study, the research hypotheses were verified by applying multiple regression analysis and co-integration regression analysis on the 145 usable results from using the statistical program of SPSS 24.0. The results of this study are as follows. First, hypothesis 1, the analysis of positive(＋) influence on organizational effectiveness on the characteristics of the system (selection system, evaluation and compensation, education and training opportunity, member participation system, job stability) was adopted due to its' positive(＋) and significant relationship. Second, hypothesis 2, an analysis that the organizational effectiveness would have a positive impact on organizational performance was adopted due to its' proven work.
However, its' effectiveness will need verification. Third, regression analysis was conducted to confirm the role of the hypothesis 3, personnel management effectiveness, between the high performance and the work system (selection system, evaluation/compensation, education/training opportunity, member participation system, job stability). As a result, Hypothesis 3 showed that the selection system (H3-1), evaluation and compensation(H3-2), education and career opportunities(H3-3), member participation system(H3-4), job stability(H3-4) showed that organizational effectiveness has a moderating role in HR effectiveness. The main implication of this study is that the positive and working system recognized by the organizational members has positive affects on organizational effectiveness and organizational performance. In order to enhance the substantiality management system through improvement of organizational performance, a regular implementation plan on a high-performance working system along with education & training system to improve organizational effectiveness is required so that the members of the organization could form a consensus. Second, as a result of confirming the moderating effects of HR management effectiveness, the moderating role of HR management system and organization effectiveness was verified positive. Therefore, this study shows that the part that verifies both organizational effectiveness and organizational performance through high-performance working system and the part that confirmed the role of control between high-performance work system and organizational effectiveness are the biggest difference from the previous research.High Performance Working System, Organizational Effectiveness, Organizational Performance, HR Effectiveness, Selection System, Evaluation and Compensation, Training and Career Opportunity, Member Participation System, Job Stability"

For continuous innovation, an organization always needs employees that voluntarily change and improve themselves and eventually show innovative behavior, which refers to creation and management of technology and information. It is important to know what encourages employees to behave in an innovative way and how an organization can influence this kind of behavior.
Not surprisingly, human resources are becoming a driving force for innovative behavior. However, little research has attempted to investigate the relationship between high-commitment HRM system and employees’ innovative behavior, which plays an vital role for producing competitiveness. In addition, scant research has interested in first-line managers’ involvement in HRM although they take strategic roles in HR implementation, especially in the relationship between HRM practices and their employees’ innovative behavior.
In this respect, this study is particularly concerned with the relationship between high-commitment HRM system and innovative behavior. And, the study examines the moderating effects of LMX and first-line managers’ HR competency between high-commitment HRM system and innovative behavior.
The study objective is formulated as follows: First, to what extent can high-commitment HRM system of an organization improve the innovative behavior of their employees? Second, this study adds to investigate whether LMX and first-line managers’ HR competency moderate between high-commitment HRM system and employees’ innovative behavior.
Data were collected through questionnaire instruments from 375 employees in 78 SMEs. To test hypotheses, descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, confirmative factor analysis and multiple regression analysis were employed with SPSS 21.0 and Amos 18.0.
The statistical results of this study revealed that high-commitment HRM system positively influenced innovative behavior as assumed in the hypothesis, and LMX and first-line managers’ HR competency each positively intensified the effect of high-commitment HRM system on innovative behavior.
The results of the empirical study gave a significant implication that well designed high-commitment HRM system can enhance employees’ innovative behave. In addition, organizations should encourage FLMs to improve their LMX and HR competency so that they can effectively complete their HR tasks for innovative behavior of their employees.High-Commitment Work System, Innovative Behavior, First-Line Managers, LMX, HR Competency"

However, the HR management of them is in charge of the North Korean managers and watchmen so that long-term HR development for them is not achieved. This study suggests that Chinese firms should provide systematic HRM practices to them to protect their human rights and QWL and promote their productivity. In addition, customized HRD programs need to be provied to them. An agreement about HRM between the governments of China and North Korea is need to insure the fulfillment of the employment contracts.

HRI가 1% 증가하면 기업의 매출액은 1.5%, 기업의 경상이익은 2% 이상 증가하는 것으로 나타났다. 또한 HRI 1점 증가가 가져오는 1인당 매출액과 1인당 경상이익액의 증가를 계산해 보면 각각 1,561만 원과 184만 원으로 그 효과가 상당히 가시적이다.
HRI는 근로자의 임금에도 정의 영향을 미치고 있어, HRI가 1% 증가하면 근로자의 임금은 0.6% 증가하는 것으로 나타났고, 이는 HRI 1점 증가당 약 3만원 이상의 임금 증가를 의미한다. HRI의 증가가 기업의 성과를 제고하고 근로자의 임금을 올리기 때문에 노사협력으로 HRI를 제고하는 것은 노사상생의 길이라 할 수 있다.This article works on the investigating of relations between Human Resources Index(HRI) and performance in Korean Business. Used data is Human Capital Corporate Panel(HCCP) survey which was made by Korea Institute Research for Vocational Education and Training(KRIVET).
HRIs have the positive effect on the performance in the firms. The increase of 1% in HRI results in the increase of 1.5% in wholesale of firms. The increase of 1% in HRI results in the increase of 2% in profit of firms. This rate is comparatively high to the effect of 0.4% in tangible assets. 
The increase of 1 point in HRI results in the increase of 15,610,000￦ of per capita wholesale and 1,840,000￦ of per capita profit. The amount of expenses to raise up 1 point in HRDI(Human Resoruces Development Index) is 165,000￦ in per capita training expenses, but the increase of 1 point in HRDI results in the increase of 5,200,000￦ of per capita wholesale and 840,000￦ of per capita profit.
HRIs have also the positive effects on the wages of workers in the firms. The increase of 1% in HRI results in the increase of 0.6% in wages. This means that the increase of 1 point in HRIs results in the increase of 30,000￦ of wages.This article works on the investigating of relations between Human Resources Index(HRI) and performance in Korean Business.

According to 5 year plan for in copy right industry promotion prepared by Copy Right Evaluation and Adjustment Review Committe, it is claimed that direct and indirect spill-over effect on inducing a nation's industrial production is larger than that of manufacturing or service sector. Higher growth of copy right related industry has been observed in comparison with average economic growth rate in the middle of its stagnant growth in leading economies.
Looking at overall status of the industry, composition ratio of the U.S. copy right industry represents 40.4%, Japan, Britain, Germany, China, France, Italy, Spain, Canada and Korea follow in order of the ratio. Although Korea's economic growth is projected to stay low, local cultural content market achieves double growth ratio compared to it, and copy right industry grows steadily. The phenomina leads to conclude that HR manpower needed by copy right industry will increase continuously. In particular, it is forecasted that Han Ryu(Korea Cultural Infulence) effect will spread out all over the cultural spectrum from narrow or single band, and reach out worldwide from Asian region.
In addition, advancement of broadband networks, and IT and communications technology rapidly enable ubiquitous environment, and digital technology induces integration of segregated procedures and segments extending stages of planning, development, and manufacturing steps and procedures. Under the contemporary environment, it is required that national competitiveness through development of related HR with expertise must be secured first. This research investigated and analyzed education systems and courses for related HR development practiced in Korea and overseas countries to learn indicative points and suggest challenges and solutions for development of HR manpower with expertise in copy right.creativeness, intellectual property, copy right"

Our findings suggest that HR practices designated as a dependent variable do not affect intention to join unions in the public sector, whereas HR practices provide significant and meaningful impacts on intention to join union in the private sector. Specifically, union instrumentality is positively associated with intention to join union in the private sector for three years in a row. To diminish the negative perceptions on labor unions, we suggest that unions should not only stand for the interests of specific groups, but also design, implement, and manage WLB and diversity policies within organizations. While public sector unions are more actively involved with legal and institutional issues than private sector unions, we also recognize that, as the union membership is only available to low-level employees, there are a lot of difficulties and limitations to represent and actualize core interests of the whole public sector employees. Additionally, the theoretical and practical implications of this research are explained.Intention to join union, Four major public insurance, Family friendly policy, Support for individual growth, Union instrumentality"

 방 법: 2002년 3월부터 2003년 6월까지 반복성 구토, 기침, 흉통, 보챔 등 위식도 역류가 의심되어 한양대 병원 소아과에 입원한 환아 23명(남：여=12：11, 평균연령 27개월)을 대상으로 24시간 pH 검사와 식도 동위 원소 검사를 시행하였다.
 결 과: 24시간 식도 pH 검사 결과 23명의 환아 중 6명(26.1%)에서 유의한 위식도 역류가 관찰되었으며 2명의 환아는 보채서 결과를 얻을 수 없었다. 식도 동위 원소 검사 결과 23명 중 9명(39.2%)의 환아에서 위식도 역류가 영상학적으로 관찰되었다. 24시간 식도 pH 검사와 식도 동위 검사 모두에서 양성으로 나온 환아는 3명(14.3%), 모두 음성으로 나온 환아는 9명(42.9%)이었으며 24시간 식도 pH 검사만 양성으로 나온 환아는 3명(14.3%), 식도 동위 원소 검사에서만 양성으로 나온 환아는 6명(28.6%)이었다. 두 검사의 결과를 Fisher's exact test와(p=0.523) Kendall의 타우(근사 유의 확률=0.678)로 비교하였고 두 검사 간의 결과의 연관성은 관찰되지 않았다.
 결 론: 24시간 식도 pH검사와 식도 동위 원소 검사는 연관성이 없고 서로 다른 방법의 검사이므로 이 두 검사는 상호 보완적으로 시행하는 것이 위식도 역류 환자를 진단할 때 유용하다.Purpose: Many diagnostic modalities have been used for diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Feeding materials during esophageal pH monitoring may interfere the result of examination and esophageal pH monitoring can not diagnose GER in case of alkaline reflux. The purpose of our study is to evaluate whether scintigraphy can substitiute 24 hr pH monitoring in children with GERD. 
Methods: From March 2002 to June 2003, 23 patients (12 boys and 11 girls, mean age 27 months) who have been admitted to Hanyang University Hospital presented with GER symptoms (recurrent vomiting, cough, chest pain, irritability) were included in the study. Scintigraphy and 24 hr pH monitoring were performed in all patients.
Results: Six out of the 23 patients (26.1%) had evidence of GER on 24 hr pH monitoring, whereas nine of 23 patients (39.2%) exhibited GER by scintigraphy. Two out of the 23 patients could not be tested because of irritability. Three (14.3%) patients had evidence of GER on both 24 hr pH monitoring and scintigraphy, three (14.3%) patients on only 24 hr pH monitoring, six (28.6%) patients on only scintigraphy, and nine (42.9%) patients had no evidence of GER on both methods. No correlation was observed between 24 hr pH monitoring and scintigraphic results by Fisher's exact test (p=0.523) or Kendal's tau (t=0.678).
Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrated that there was no correlation between 24 hr pH monitoring and scintigraphy. Therefore these modalities could be used as complementary tests to diagnose GERD.Purpose: Many diagnostic modalities have been used for diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Adopting an upper-echelons perspective and attention-based view, we suggest that top management’s HR-oriented values are the fundamental determinants of the HPWSs as well as changes of the HPWSs over time. Moreover, we propose that top management’s HR-oriented values moderate the positive relationship between firm performance and HPWSs. By addressing the question of why some firms adopt HPWS programs more broadly than other firms by investigating fundamental determinants of HPWSs, we aim to improve our understanding of the linkage between HPWSs and firm performance over the long run. We tested our model using longitudinal panel data from the Human Capital Corporate Panel (HCCP) and analyzed the data over the 2005-2013 period using latent growth modeling methodology. Our final sample consisted of 406 South Korean firms based on five discrete periods (i.e., 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013). Our empirical results indicate that top management’s HR-oriented values affect the change of HPWSs positively. We also found a significant interaction effect between firm performance and top management’s HR-oriented values on the changes of HPWSs. In particular, firms with lack of HR-oriented value affected greater increment or decrement in HPWSs by changes in firm performance over time. The result of this study shows that the firms with higher HR-oriented values invest more on HPWSs in the long-term perspective than the firms with lower HR-oriented values regardless of the performance change.top management values, change in high performance work system, latent growth modeling, firm performance"

Therefore, this study examined the perceptions of employment competency and recruitment methods of youth for youth-friendly small- and medium-sized companies. Through the results, this study is to explore the implications for revitalizing and strengthening youth employment competency enhancement programs. Research problems are as follows. First, what are the HR practitioner's perceived competencies for employment? Second, what are the effective job preparation activities recognized by the HR practitioner? Third, what are the talent and evaluation methods that companies value when hiring new employees? Fourth, how does a company experience hiring new employees? Fifth, among the competencies that companies require for new employees, which compentency that a job seeker can prepare? In conclusion, HR practitioners who responded to the survey selected ‘personality and attitude’ and ‘job understanding’ as the most necessary and highly reflective competencies for employment. In addition, ‘job related education’ is the most necessary activity for helping to prepare for employment. ‘Humanity’ and ‘job competency’ were the most important factors to emphasize when hiring new employees.

Yet, the results of previous studies have been a emerging consensus that the isomorphism and homogeneity of HRM and HR practices among firms regardless of thoese industrial areas, size, organizational settings, etc. are universal. Based on the previous studies of similarities of HRM, the paper theoretically investigates the background and reasons of introducing similar HR practices among firms. The paper shows the dynamism of HR system in Korean firms, adapting a new HR system. Three types of reasons are found, coercive isomorphism, mimetic isomorphism, and normative isomorphism.

In the first experiment, the graded exercise test was executed for walking and running to determine the changing point of economic efficiency for each exercise. In the second experiment, the subjects were performed to walk at the speed of the changing point of economic efficiency±1kph, and running speed was set by the same O2 of walking, respectively. HR and SBP were measured immediately after walking or running for 5 minutes with the selected speed and DP was calculated from HR and SBP. The results are as follows. 1) The HR of walking was higher than that of running with the same o2 in changing point of economic efficiency-1kph. However, there wasn't any significant difference between HR of walking with the changing point of economic efficiency+1kph and of running with the same O2. 2) For the SBP, there wasn't any significant difference between walking with the changing point of economic efficiency-1kph and running with the same O2. However, the SBP of walking with the changing point of economic efficiency+1kph was higher than that of running with the same O2. 3) The DP of walking was higher than that of running with the changing point of economic efficiency-1kph and +1kph. The results represented that the DP is higher in walking than in running with the scope of the changing point of economic efficiency±1kph for walking and running, even if the O2 is the same.

Huselid and Becker (2000), based on their research using four national surveys over 2,000 firms, concluded that “the effect of a one standard deviation change in the HPWPs is 10-20% of a firm’s market value.” In addition, according to Combs et al.’s (2006) metaanalysis,the corrected effect size of the HPWPs on firm performance was .20, which means that “a one standard deviation increase in the use of HPWPs translates, on average, to a 4.6percentage-point increase in gross ROA.”However, in many previous studies focusing on the level of system or bundle of HR practices,it has been implicitly assumed that the relationship between each high performance work practice (HPWP) and firm performance was positively linear, which means that the more intensively does each HPWP within the bundle get implemented, the better firm performance is expected. The assumption has been reflected in the way of researchers’ calculating a high performance HR system index, in which the extents to which individual HPWPs are implemented in the workplace are additively summed up. However, this method is challenged by research findings that some motivation-enhancing HPWPs could have non-linear relationships with firm performance.
Psychological research suggests that excessive rewards can result in a decline in individual performance. One mechanism that can produce a perverse relationship between motivation and performance is related to increased self-consciousness (Baumeister, 1984; Langer &Imber, 1979; requoted from Ariely et al., 2005). Increasing self-consciousness due to a strong cash incentive can cause people to consciously think about the task, shifting control from ‘automatic’ to ‘controlled’ processes that are less effective.
Another mechanism by which increased motivation is also likely to have a negative effect on performance relates to a general focus of attention (Easterbrook, 1959; requoted from Ariely et al., 2005). Attentional focus can be detrimental for tasks that involve insight or creativity,since increased motivation tends to narrow individuals’ focus of attention to the way they are accustomed to, although creativity and insight require drawing unusual connections between elements. McGraw & McCullers (1978) provided support for this mechanism by showing that the introduction of monetary rewards for tasks that involved problem-solving had detrimental effects on performance. In addition, large incentives intented to increase extrinsic motivation can do harm to intrinsic motivation (Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 1999).
Research examining pay dispersion also suggests that pay differences among employees in the same rank can generate both positive and negative effects within the workplace. With higher levels of pay dispersion, greater potential exists for employers to motivate employees through the use of financial rewards (Cadsby, Song & Tapon, 2007). However, pay dispersion also creates a potential for competition among employees to interfere with cooperation (Yang & Klaas, in press). Further, to the extent that the legitimacy of managerial judgments regarding individual performance remains questionable, greater pay dispersion has the potential to lead to higher levels of perceived inequity. Similarly, Shaw, Gupta & Delery (2002) found that pay dispersion among employees negatively affected organizational outcomes when there were high levels of interdependence and also when the firm lacked systematic means by which to measure employee contributions. Yang & Klaas (in press) also found that a horizontal pay dispersion practice has an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm performance among Korean firms.
The above research findings tell that the additive way of creating a HPWP system index based on the assumption that the relationship between each HPWP and firm performance is positively linear needs to be reexamined. This study designed to figure out the causal relationship between a high performance HR system and firm performance by adopting an alternative way of indexing a high performance HR system, that is, a profile deviation method.
A profile deviation method in this context sets up an ideal profile of high performance HR system and then calculate a firm’s HR system index based on the extent to which its HR system deviates from the ideal high performance HR system. This profile deviation method can be flexibly used even under the condition that the relationship between a certain HPWP and firm performance is not linear.
The hypothesis was tested with two data sets obtained from a government sponsored survey,which has been conducted every two years since 2005. The sample was drawn from the firms with more than 100 employees in the corporate database maintained by the Korea Information Service and firm performance data for relevant years which were obtained from the KIS corporate database were combined with the survey data. In 2005 data, 409 firms were included,while in 2007 data, 419 firms were included in the sample. In this study high performance HR system indices were drawn from two different methods, that is, an additive method and a profile deviation method for a comparison purpose. As far as the research design was concerned,a ‘predictive’ design, where the relationship between HR practices and post-performance is explored, as compared to ‘post-predictive’ design, where the relationship between current HR system and past performance is explored, or ‘contemporaneous’ design, where the relationship between the contemporaneous HR system and performance is explored, was adopted with past firm performance controlled.
The results show that a causal relationship between high performance HR system and firm performance exists. Meanwhile, the profile deviation method was found to be more powerful in detecting existing effects than the additive method when some high performance HPWPs have a non-linear relationship with firm performance. The result implies that the profile deviation method is more robust than the additive method in detecting the effects of a high performance HR system on firm performance. The implications and limitations of the study are discussed in conclusion section.high performance work system, profile deviation method, causal relationship,predictive design"

Internalization of HR practice is that state in which the employees at the recipient attach symbolic meaning to the practice. A practice becomes infused with value when the employee see the value of using the practice, and when the practice becomes part of the employees' organizational identity. Therefore internalization of HR practice and job commitment are key elements of organizational effectiveness. This study attempted to empirical tests not only relationship between internalization of HR practice and job commitment, role-tiredness, turnover intention, but also examines effect of role-tiredness on job commitment and turnover intention. Data were collected through questionnaire instruments from 1,117 employees of Job Center. To test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling employed. Research findings are summarized as follows. First, internalization of HR practice has a positively significant effect on job commitment. Second, internalization of HR practice has a negatively significant effect on role-tiredness, and turnover intention. Third, role-tiredness has a positively effect on turnover intention, however we could not found an effect of role-tiredness on job commitment. The results of this study imply that internalization of HR practice has a critical effect on turnover intention through job commitment.internalization of practice, job commitment, tiredness, turnover intention"

The Empirical models are based on the rational choice perspective and the institutional iso-morphism perspective. The results of this study are as follows. (1) Rational choice perspective: employment variations as an indicator of organizational flexibility have a significantly positive effect on informal HR practices in SMEs, and employment size as an indicator of indirect control system has significantly negative effects on informal HR practices in SMEs. Skill requirement has partially significantly negative effects on informal HR practices in SMEs, but educational levels and tenures do not. (2) Institutional iso-morphism perspective: Foreign direct investor's shares, unionization, professional CEO,and networks with external HR specialists have significantly negative effects on informal HR practices in SMEs. Export ratio and the existence of benchmarker have weakly significant negative effects, but institutional customer and the number of HR staffs do not. Overall, the results of this study indicate that both the rational choice perspective and the iso-morphism perspective account for the informal HR practices in SMEs reasonably well, and that the latter perspective has better explanatory power. Finally, the results are summarized and their implications are discussed.personnel management in smes, informality of personnel management, rational choices, institutional iso-morphism, workplace panel survey"

The research method of this study is based on both literature reviews and case analysis. The findings are concerned with growth factors as well as barriers of a HR outsourcing company affiliated to a Korean large company. The developmental stage of Korean HR outsourcing industry is currently at a premature stage, far less delvelped than U.S. and European outsourcing industry. In particular, key barriers of HR outsourcing to domestic companies are uncertainty of outsourcing contract and conflict on outsourcing costs between contractors. Korean large companies still regard outsourcing service as contracting-out or employee leasing. HR outsourcing service must aim at process-improvement rather than cost-saving as outsourcing service is more professionalized. However, in Koran companies cost saving is one of top reasons for HR outsourcing. Korean HR outsourcing can be explained well from a perspective of transaction cost theory because cost factor plays a key role. In contrast, U.S. and European companies tend to put more emphasis on process improvement than cost savings, which is explained well from a perspective of resource based theory. This study investigated a HR oursourcing company that was affiliated with a large company. The finding from case analysis is twofolds. One is that trust between contractors, process standardization, measurement of HR service quality, shared views of HR outsourcing are key growth factors. The other is that lacks in service expertise, low competency of HR outsourcing staffs, and unspecificity of outsourcing contracts are all barriers to HR outsourcing service.outsourcing, human resource outsourcing, transaction cost theory, resource based theory"

This study focuses on the attitudes of union presidents toward the IHRM, since they play key roles in making decisions about whether the union will accept or oppose it. Three perspectives, social network, agent role, and company commitment, were adopted. Using data from 122 company union presidents and a structural equation model, this study found that the destruction of social network is the most important variable in explaining their attitude toward the IHRM. Agent role and company commitment were also significant factors.

Especially, performance of IEEE 802.15.3 High-Rate WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network) which is operated in ISM unlicensed frequency band is easily affected by channel errors. In this paper, we propose a schedulingalgorithm which takes channel errors into consideration in scheduling asynchronous data traffic. The proposed scheduling algorithm can allocate CTA(Channel Time Allocation) proportionally in accordance with the requested channel time of each device. It also prevents waste of channel time by allocating CTA of the channel-error devices to other channel-error free devices. After recovering from the channel error, the devices are compensated as much as they conceded during channel error status. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm is superior to the existing SRPT(Shortest Remain Processing Time) and RR(Round Robin) in throughput and fairness aspects.HR-WPAN, wireless scheduling, channel-error, fair scheduling"

Thirty-six participants were asked to putt the ball as close to the target as possible.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups that differed in the number of a 24-hr rest interval between practice sessions. In the first group participants took a 24-hr rest between two practice sessions. The second group took two 24-hr rests between three practiced sessions. The third group took three 24-hr rests between four practice sessions. The group with three rest intervals revealed significantly better performance in 24-hr retention test than the group with a rest interval. The group with two rest intervals also showed better retention performance than the group with a rest interval although the difference did not reach a significance. The present results suggest that the number as well as the length of a rest interval interpolated between practice sessions can be a learning variable that decides the effect of a distributed practice. The learning effect observed in the multiple rest group may be attributable to the consolidation process during the first rest interval and reactivation and reconsolidation processes during the additional practice sessions and rest intervals.Motor Learning, Distributed Practice, Memory Consolidation"

Despite this need, the extent to which HR departments move to strategic roles isvery different for each company. The differences in the degree of HR’s strategic role have led manyresearchers to make efforts to identify which organizational and external factors affect the HR's strategicrole.This study noted Labor-Management(LM) Climate among the factors affecting the strategicrole of HR department. Based on the Power Dynamics and Resource Allocation Theory, this studyargued on the impact of LM climate on the HR’s strategic role. From a power dynamics point ofview, hostile labor-management climate can be predicted to serve as a situational factor that couldhighlight the importance of human resources to other departments within the organization, thus furtherstrengthening the strategic role of HR department. That is, the strategic role of HR department requiresa different form of resource distribution than before, so new agreements with other departments arenecessary. At this time a hostile labor-management climate could form a context in which the HRdepartment could be given strategic role. Conversely, it can be also predicted that hostile LM climate will weaken the performanceof the new strategic-oriented role by exhausting HR resources to existing operational-oriented roles.According to the resource allocation theory, the performance of a particular role inevitably involvesthe exhaustion of resources to perform other roles. Therefore, negative LM climate could lead HR department more focus on operational and functional roles, which actively prevent disputes and activelylisten to complaints of workers.To verify competing hypotheses about the impact of Labor-Management(LM) climate onthe strategic role of the HR Department, this study used the results of the Korea Labor Institute'sWorkplace Panel Survey(WPS) and to build a balanced panel and conduct a longitudinal analysison 110 corporates that responded at all times from the first to seventh.As a result of the empirical analysis, it was confirmed that is the more hostile the LMclimate within the company, the more strategic role the HR Department plays. These results suggestthat if the climate of LM is hostile, corporate strategic resources are concentrated on the HR Departmentto remove uncertainties within the company. In addition, this study is meaningful that is consistent with the prior cross-sectional studiesthrough the panel analysis, a more rigorous causal analysis. It is commonly suggested that the strategicresources of the company are concentrated on HR department and the strategic importance and roleof HR is increased in order to eliminate uncertainties within the company. In particular, as hostileLM Climate has been pointed out as a major factor in weakening corporate competitiveness in Korea,this study could provide important implications. Through the results of this study, we emphasizedthe role of LM climate on strategic role of HR department, and the limitations of the research andthe direction of further research were discussed.Labor-Management Climate, Strategic role of Human Resources, Power Dynamics, Resource Allocation Theory, Panel Analysis"

In animals and plants, cytosolic Ca^(2+) signals have been involved in the activation of programmed cell death (PCD). Recently, we reported that disruption of Arabidopsis vacuolar Autoinhibited Ca^(2+) -ATPases (ACAs), ACA4 and ACA11, resulted in the activation of a salicylic acid-dependent programmed cell death pathway. Although extensive studies have revealed various components of a PCD in plants, executors to directly induce PCD are well unknown. Here, we provide that the vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) are involved in a PCD induced by the double knockout mutant of vacuolar Ca^(2+) -ATPases in Arabidopsis. The gene expression of VPE was rapidly up-regulated and the enzyme activity of VPE was increased in the double mutant plants. We also generated aca4/aca11/αvpe, aca4/aca11/γvpe and aca4/aca11/ αvpe/γvpe mutant plants. Although cell death phenotype of the double mutant plants was not completely disappeared in the triple and quadruple mutant plants, the triple and quadruple mutant plants showed to significantly delay cell death phenotype of the double mutant plants. These results suggest that the VPE is involved in the HR-like cell death in the double mutant of vacuolar Ca^(2+) -ATPases in Arabidopsis"

In addition, this study also predicts that firm performance and job satisfaction will be high when employees participate in the process of establishing a performance oriented HR system.
This study surveyed 220 employees who hired more than 100 regular employees in Korea and tested the hypotheses by regression analysis.
The practices that showed positive effects on the firm performance of the performance oriented HR system were identified as the special training for low performer, stressing a performance evaluation in organization, incentive for individual and team. The interaction variables of performance oriented HR system and employee participation also showed a positive effect on firm performance. Statistically significant variables were stressing a performance evaluation in organization, MBO and muli-faceted evaluation, incentive for individual and team. The interactional variables of performance oriented HR system and employee participation were not statistically significant with respect to job satisfaction.
Performance oriented HR system practices reflecting the unique characteristics of domestic industrial sites were derived through organizational behavioral theories (expectation, fairness, reinforcement, control theory). When an organization establishes a performance oriented HR system, it can be competitive only by involving employees.Performance Oriented Human Resource System, Employee Participation, Firm Performance, Job Satisfaction"

Human resource must be strategically managed in order for an organization to achieve its goal, actively develop professional knowledge, skill, and ability of those human resources, and attain a sustainable competitive advantage through human resource performance. Human resource system arrives to conclusive results through people and process in causal relationship and HPWS is considered as an innovative human resource management(HRM) system. Therefore it is difficult for such innovative HRM systems to affect organizational performance results without mediating roles of HR performance. In detail, this study analyzes how additions and removals of HPWS’s HR practices affect an organization’s HR performance, and what effects ultimately contribute to organizational performance through HR performance. Based on the analysis of 437 manufacturing, finance, and service companies on KRIVET(Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education & Training)’s HCCP(Human Capital Corporate Panel) data(2013~2015) and KIS’s corporate data, we found that the additions of new HR practices that can be part of HPWS increased HR performance while the removals of HR practices consisting HPWS decreased it. In turn, an increase in HR performance led to higher organizational performance. After an assessment of mediating effects of HR performance in the relationship between the changes in HPWS and organizational performance, the additions of new HR practices showed positive valid effects towards organizational performance through HR performance while the removals of HR practices showed negative effects towards organizational performance through HR performance. Aforementioned results confirmed how the expansion and reduction in terms of the number of HR practices that consist HPWS ultimately contributed to organizational performance by affecting HR performance such as employees’ job performance and motivation. Implications of these findings in the use of HPWS were discussed.High Performance Work Systems(HPWS), HPWS Changes, Organizational Performance, Human Resource Performance, Strategic Human Resource Management(SHRM)"

첫째, 전략적 인적자원개발의 특성과 상관관계를 가지며 유의미한 영향을 끼치는 인적자원개발의 가치지향성은 ‘사회적으로 책임 있는 조직 확립’, ‘개인의 직무성과 개선’, ‘조직의 성과개선’ 가치지향성으로 확인되었다. 둘째, 인적자원개발의 전략적 성숙도와 상관관계를 가지며 유의미한 영향을 끼치는 가치지향성은 ‘조직의 성과개선’ 및 ‘사회적으로 책임 있는 조직 확립’ 가치지향성으로 나타났다. 
본 연구 결과를 통해 기업의 사회적 책임을 강조하는 가치지향성이 조직의 성과개선을 추구하는 가치지향성보다 인적자원개발의 전략적 성숙도에 더 큰 영향을 미치는 것을 알 수 있는데, 이는 최근 급속히 증가하고 있는 윤리경영, 사회공헌활동 등 기업의 사회적 책임을 실천하는 것이 기업의 인적자원개발 전략화에도 긍정적 영향을 미친다는 것을 보여주는 것이다. 따라서 기업의 사회적 공헌활동 수준을 높임으로써 인적자원개발의 전략화를 추구할 수 있음을 알 수 있다.The aim of this study was to find a specific factors that effect to deepening the maturity of strategic HRD which emerges as a new mainstream in the field of human resource development. To put it concretely this study sought to measure the empirical relationship between HRD practitioners' value priority and the strategic maturity of HRD of their organizations. In order to induce the result, the investigator carried out the survey by 93 HRD practitioners in various South Korean organizations. Based on the HRD value matrix and survey items designed by Bates and Chen(2004) as well as the strategic maturity of HRD model designed by McCracken and Wallace(2000b), the strategic maturity was measured through correlation and regression analysis. The result of this research can be summarized as the follows.
 First, there exists specific value priorities of HRD especially 'Building Socially Responsible Organization', 'Improving Individual Job Performance' and 'Improving Organizational Performance' have the correlation with the nine characteristics of strategic HRD. And these three HRD value priorities influences characteristics of strategic HRD.
 Second, the extent of correlation level between the HRD value priorities and the characteristics of strategic HRD is 'Improving Organizational Performance' > 'Building Socially Responsible Organization' > 'Improving Individual Job Performance' > 'Building Learning Systems' > 'Providing Individuals with Learning Experiences' > 'Enabling Meaningful Work'. Especially, the 'Improving Organizational Performance' value and of 'Building Socially Responsible Organization' value influence to the maturity of strategic HRD. Based on the above outputs following results can be derived. 
 First, there exists the specific priorities of HRD those can deepen the maturity of strategic HRD. And it shows that HR practitioner should be a changing consultant rather than a training program provider.
 Second, the results tell that 'Building Socially Responsible Organization' value influences maturity of strategic HRD more than 'Improving Organizational Performance'. It means that organizations which emphasize social responsibility of corporation like ethic management or social contribution of corporation would be more strategic in their HRD activities. So if they want to reach higher level of strategic maturity an organization should emphasize the social responsibility activity.The aim of this study was to find a specific factors that effect to deepening the maturity of strategic HRD which emerges as a new mainstream in the field of human resource development.

Methods: This was a retrospective, observational studyusing a prospectively collected hypothermia registry conductedat a single tertiary hospital over three years. Weincluded patients who were monitored by sEEG within threedays after resuscitation. We evaluated the prognostic valueof continuous activity pattern (diffuse slowing or normalwave) for good outcome predictor and malignant pattern(epileptiform, burst suppression, and isoelectric pattern) forpoor outcome predictors during hypothermia and normothermiaperiod.
Results: Of 98 patients, continuous activity was displayedin 45 patients. Of these, 27 were included in the good outcomegroup, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of60.0% (sensitivity and specificity of 100.0 and 74.6%,respectively). Malignant patterns resulted in a PPV of100.0% for poor outcomes (sensitivity and specificity of35.2% and 100.0%, respectively). Continuous activity duringhypothermia showed better prognostic performance forgood outcome than those during normothermia (area underthe curve (AUC)=0.900 (95% confidence interval (CI)0.825-0.975) and AUC=0.827 (95% CI 0.692-0.962),respectively). For the poor outcome prediction, the AUCwas 0.712 (95% CI 0.536-0.887) for malignant patterns duringnormothermia, and 0.656 (95% CI 0.522-0.789) forthose during hypothermia.
Conclusion: For patients treated with TH, continuous activityon sEEG, particularly during hypothermia, could contributeto the prediction of good outcomes with high specificity.

[Methodology] For empirical analyses, this paper constructs the measures for the business strategy and the staffing levels and competency. The business strategy is constructed following Bentley et al.’s(2013) method that locates prospector and defender on the extreme ends of strategy continuum. The HR policies on internal controls are analyzed in terms of the staffing levels and competency, and the competency is defined as expertise and work experience.
[Findings] It is found that the strategy significantly positively affects the staffing levels and competency for internal accounting controls. Specifically, the number of employees, the ratio of CPAs, and work experience increase as the degree to which prospector characteristics are satisfied increases. The additional analysis based on strategy components shows that the influence of each strategy component on the staffing levels and competency is different. In addition, the analysis based on the prospector-vs-defender classification shows that the risks embedded in business strategy are associated with staffing levels and expertise more than with work experience.
[Implications] By identifying business strategy as an additional risk factor reflected in the HR policies for internal controls, this paper extends the understanding of the determinants of the staffing levels and competency for internal accounting controls.Internal Control over Financial Reporting, Human Resource for Internal Controls, Human Resource Management, Strategy, Prospector."

본 연구에서는 고성과 작업시스템(high performance work system)과 기업의 재무적 성과 (자산수익률)/비재무적 성과(종업원 만족도) 간의 관계에 있어서 고성과 작업시스템의 효과적 운영 정도의 조절효과를 파악하고 있다. 연구결과, 고성과 작업시스템의 도입만으로는 제도의 효과를 충분히 얻을 수 없으며, 기업 내에서 효과적으로 관리되는 과정을 통하여 고성과 작업시스템과 기업의 성과간의 관계의 강도가 증가하는 것으로 나타났다. 이러한 결과를 바탕으로 본 연구의 시사점, 한계 및 향후 연구 과제 등에 대하여 논하고 있다.The research in the field of SHRM(strategic human resource management) argues the human capital in the firm can be regarded as one of the sources for competitive advantages of a firm and tries to find out ways to increase motivation and job skills of employees and to improve the firm performance.
Although there are many empirical studies on the association between human resource management practices and firm performance, only a few research focus on the internal process in which this association takes place. This study attempts to find out the moderating role of the effectiveness of human resource management practices in the relationship between high performance work systems and financial performance (return on asset) and non-financial performance (job satisfaction of employees). The results in this study show that there are positive associations between HR practices and financial/non-financial performance of a firm and the level of strength of these associations can be higher when firms effectively administer their HR practices.High Performance Work Systems, Financial Performance, Job Satisfaction, Effectiveness"

Immediately after slaughter, a total number of 30 carcasses(Hanwoo bull) selected, and sarcomere length was determined during rigor development(1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hr). Tenderness group of longissimus dorsi muscle classified into tender group(≤7.5 kg/cm2, n=9), or tough group(≥9.0 kg/㎠, n=9) by shear force value at 24 hr postmortem, and estimated carcass traits, meat color, connective tissue and sensory property at 24 hr postmortem. Results showed that tender group had heavier carcass weight, thicker back fat, higher marbling score, lighter meat color, more white fat color and lower texture score(p<0.05). The change of sarcomere length was linearly decreased(p<0.05) from 3 hr postmortem, and the sarcomere length of tender group was significantly(p<0.05) longer than that of tough group at 3, 6 and 24 hr postmortem. The tender group showed significantly lower(p<0.05) shear force value of intramuscular connective tissue(IMCT), better(p<0.05) tenderness and overall acceptability compared to the tough group. Results indicated that tenderness of beef longissimus dorsi muscle could be improved by thicker back fat, higher marbling score and lower texture score, and predicted by sarcomere length of pre-rigor(3 and 6 hr postmortem). Also, the tenderness of beef longissimus dorsi muscle could be closely related to shear force value of IMCT, compared to total collagen and soluble collagen content in the same age.Hanwoo bull, tenderness, collagen, sarcomere length"

It focuses on the analysis of multi-dimension of HRD practices by involving varied elements such as the HRD participants, training hours and costs reflecting firms' investment on HRD at the workplaces. This study provides some useful insights to the HRD strategies in Korea as follows. First, the HRD investment is positively associated with the gross profit of the Korean companies. Among the three variables this study involved, the ratio of training participants have strong effects on the gross profit, which implies that the government should call the companies to provide more opportunities for all the employees. The HRD investment is higly linked to the positive human resources outcomes. Ratio of training participants, training hours and training costs have positive correlations with ability to work, motivation and work moral, and the prevention of turnover. Among the variables affecting human resources performance, ratio of training participants were found the most influential. From this finding, it can be inferred that providing training opportunities to more workers would product better results in terms of human resource outcomes.Human Resource Development, Financial Performance, HR Outcomes"

It shows that R is located in a narrower area than G and B on the RGB color space. And skin color is more related to R than G and B. Meanwhile, when the color image is transformed to the HSI color space, the S is variously changed in accordance with skin colors. The I is changed in accordance with the quantity and angle of light. But the H is less influenced by other conditions except for color. On the basis of the aforementioned study, we propose that the threshold for skin color detection is decided by the ratio of R to H. The proposed method narrows down the range of threshold, detects more skin color and reduces mis-detection of skin color in comparison to detection by R or H.

This study postulates that the operation of the female talent pipeline will alleviate the gender stereotypes that operates as glass ceilings for women's representation in key leadership positions. Therefore, first, this study investigates HR practices affecting on functional operation of the female talent pipeline (e.g., Gender segregation, work-family balance, CEO's gender diversity attitude, mentoring, core talent female ratio, and female occupation ratio in strategic positions). Next, this study examines the female talent pipeline as a mediator between HR practices and gender stereotypes of leadership competence (e.g., functional, strategic, and reflective competencies). We tested the hypotheses with Korean Women Manager Panel Survey (6th). The results showed the low gender segregation, the ratios of women in core talent and major positions had a significant positive effect on the effective operation of female talent pipelines. Second, the operation of female talent pipeline showed a direct effect on reducing gender stereotypes of functional leadership competence. Third, the female talent pipeline demonstrated the mediating effect between organizational factors (i.e., the ratios of women in core talent and major positions, and gender segregation) and the gender stereotypes on functional leadership competence. Besides, lower gender segregation reduced gender stereotypes on strategic leadership competence through the mediating effect of female talent pipeline. The theoretical and practical implications of the pipeline of female talent are discussed.female talents’ pipeline, gender stereotypes, leadership competence, women representation"

260,"해외 M&A 과정에서의 인사 및 노무와 관련된 법적, 실무적 쟁점",김원정,2011,국제거래법학회,"Ⅰ. Introduction As the world’s economy increasingly becomes globalized, international transactions (M&A) are on the rise and as such transactions become more frequent, employment and labor related issues cannot be excluded amongst the legal due diligence items.
Without a close review of the potential employment and labor issues of the target,the success of the M&A would be at stake. In short, a thorough analysis of the employment and labor issues of the target is necessary for a successful M&A.
Ⅱ. Employment and Labor Related Issues to Consider in an global M&A First, it should be understood that the employment and labor related laws as well as consequent practices may be significantly diverse and different depending on location of the target. Second, given the diversity and differences from country to country, close coordination and communication with local employment and labor law practitioners is essential. In this regard, it cannot be stressed enough how important of a role effective and efficient communication can play in the daily progress and eventual success of the M&A.
Ⅲ. Examples of Employment & Labor Related Issues of Specific Countries Ⅳ. Case Study of an Outbound M&A (Korean company acquisition of a US based global company)First, it became very clear early on in the transaction that an understanding of the significant differences in compensation structure for top management of foreign entities from those of Korean companies was necessary. Second, as a practical matter, replacement of key personnel in a newly acquired overseas entity is difficult to achieve by local Korean management, therefore, retention of the key personnel was critical, at least for the successful short-term operations of the newly acquired overseas entity. Third, in contrast to Korea, which has a nationalized health insurance system, the cost of private health insurance as a general welfare benefit to employees by US employers (at the time of this transaction) constituted a significant portion of labor costs. Fourth, in another contrast to Korea, which mandates retirement benefits under either the statutory severance system or an option to convert to a system of corporate pensions, the US mostly leaves such benefits up to the discretion of the employer, which has resulted in a number of various types of benefits, which are in turn governed by very complicated and detailed laws. Fifth, while an overseas company looking to acquire a domestic Korean company often has concerns about the employment relationship due to the strict “just cause” requirements under the Korean Labor Standards Act, we found the domestic Korean company facing much less stringent employment relationships under the “at-will” employment system applicable generally in the US. Sixth, the nature of employment and labor disputes were found to be quite different between Korean and the US, with the US disputes focusing more on discrimination and sexual harassment issues.
Ⅴ. Conclusion As our companies continue to venture out to the global marketplace and engage increasingly in international M&As, the purpose of this article was hopefully to provide insight on why there is a particular need to be aware of the different employment and labor related issues of various countries and, to share with you the experiences of relevant professionals by providing a comparison of specific issues applicable to the US and China, which markets many of our companies are currently entering, as well as a few other countries, and to analyze those issues that, in practice, raised the most significant concerns in a case study of one of the biggest outbound M&As in recent Korean history. Due to the significant diversity in employment and labor laws and practices of various countries, it is quite difficult to generalize about employment and labor related issues that may arise in any particular M&A and the writer would like to seek understanding for not being able to fully cover all the numerous issues that this topic entails with his limited experiences, however, it is hope that with regard to such issues,further study and discussion will develop herefrom."

팔각형강관은 2축대칭 폐단면구조로 단위 길이 당 중량이 같은 경우 사각형강관에 비하여 단면2차모멘트가 크고 판의 폭-두께비는 작아휨좌굴 및 국부좌굴에 대한 압축강도가 더 크다. 또한, 원형강관에 비하여 실제 시공단계에서 버팀보의 설치, 해체, 운반 및 적재 시 유리한장점이 있다. 이 연구에서는 길이 9.6m의 팔각형강관 2개를 현장에서 볼트로 맞대기 이음하고, 양 끝에 주철로 제작한 지점연결요소를 볼트로 접합시킨 길이 20m의 팔각강관 버팀보에 대해 설계기준, 중심축의 초기폄심에 따른 유한요소해석 결과, 그리고 버팀보 재하 시험에서얻은 결과를 서로 비교하고, 버팀보의 성능을 평가하였다. 시험 결과, 모든 버팀보 시험체의 축방향 압축강도는 도로교설계기준(2012)에 따른 값과 거의 동일하거나 그 이상인 것으로 나타났다. 초기편심은 측정한 변형률 값을 이용하여 추정할 수 있으며, 모든 버팀보 시험체의경우 L/450 이하인 것으로 나타났다. 초기편심이 증가하면 버팀보의 압축강도는 감소하며, 횡방향하중으로 상재하중이 재하된 버팀보는 자중만 작용하는 경우에 비하여 초기편심의 증가로 인한 영향이 작은 것으로 나타났다. 이 연구 결과, 제작 및 설치에 의해 발생하는 오차와자중에 의한 처짐을 고려한 초기편심을 L/350 이하로 관리하면 도로교설계기준(2012)의 압축강도를 확보할 수 있을 것으로 판단된다Developed in this study were Octagonal-hollow-section(OHS) struts, whose compressive strengths against flexuraland local buckling is higher than H-shape or rectangular-hollow-section(RHS) struts with the same unit weight. OHS membersare also advantageous in handling and storing compared to circular hollow sections(CHS). OHS members were fabricated fromHR Plates by cold forming and fillet welding. 5 numbers of 20m long OHS struts were assembled, each of which consist of two9.6m long OHS member and two end connection elements made of cast iron. The compressive strength of the OHS strut wasevaluated by comparing the test results, design codes and FEM analysis each other. Test results show that all of the struts havealmost same or larger compressive strength than Korean Road Bridge Design Code(KRBDC) (2012). The initial imperfectionscan be estimated by using measured strains and are turned out to be less than L/450 for all the struts tested. The results of FEManalysis show that the variation of initial imperfection has less effects on the compressive strength for struts with verticalsurcharge than for those with self-weight only, while the strength decreases as the initial imperfection increases. As the result ofthis study, the allowable initial imperfection for 20m long OHS struts is recommended to be less than L/350 on job sites.Strut, Octagonal-hollow-section(OHS), Initial imperfection, Compressive strength"

We focus on female managers’ perception of usability of practices, rather than actual existence of practices, and examine whether perceived usability influence organizational commitment of female managers. We also investigate organizational situations that can influence the effects of family-friendly practices, that is, perceived fairness of human resource management practices as well as perceived discrimination that female managers might experience in an organization. Using data from 1145 female managers from 247 organizations across industries in Korea (Korea Women Manager Panel, 2010), we first examined the effects of usability perception of female managers on their commitment and then tested the moderating influences of perceived fairness in human resource management practices and perceived discrimination. Results revealed that supporting our hypothesis, perceived usability of practices was positively associated with organizational commitment; however, actual existence of practices was not related to commitment of female managers. Findings further indicated that the level of fairness perception of female managers positively moderated the link between usability perception and commitment, that is, the positive relationship was strengthened under high level of fairness perception but was weakened under low level of fairness perception. Also supporting the hypothesis, perceived discrimination of female managers negatively moderated the link between usability perception of family-friendly practices and organizational commitment of female managers. Theoretical and practical implications as well as limitations of the study were discussed.Family-friendly policies, fairness perception, perceived discrimination, organizational commitment"

Noticing that the subject company received HR consulting, consulting performance was evaluated in terms of two variables, HR effectiveness and organizational commitment, and the research focused on analyzing HR system improvement and change in awareness of employees.
The result showed that all lower factors that describe organizational characteristics - closeness, delegation of responsibilities, ethical management, communication and shared values - had statistically positive impact on HR effectiveness at significance level p <.05. Also, the higher the HR effectiveness, the higher the positive impact on organizational commitment improvement. Moreover, it was shown that all lower factors in organizational characteristics had positive impact on overall consulting performance. Accordingly, the research concludes that, in order to improve consulting performance, i.e., HR effectiveness and organizational commitment, for blue collar workers, the company needs to create a family-oriented and closely-knit working environment, establish rules and systems to delegate responsibilities appropriately, actively promote ethical management and provide strategic activities to facilitate effective communication.organizational characteristics, HR consulting, HR effectiveness, organizational commitment"

275,4-Hexylresorcinol-in duced angiogenesis potential in human endothelial cells,Min-Keun Kim,2020,대한악안면성형재건외과학회,"Background: 4-Hexylresorcinol (4HR) is able to increase angiogenesis. However, its molecular mechanism in the human endothelial cells has not been clarified.
Methods: As endothelial cells are important in angiogenesis, we treated the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with 4HR and investigated protein expressional changes by immunoprecipitation high-performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC) using 96 antisera.
Results: Here, we found that 4HR upregulated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/SMAD/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, RAF-B/ERK and p38 signaling, and M2 macrophage polarization pathways. 4HR also increased expression of caspases and subsequent cellular apoptosis. Mechanistically, 4HR increased TGF-β1 production and subsequent activation of SMADs/VEGFs, RAF-B/ERK and p38 signaling, and M2 macrophage polarization.
Conclusion: Collectively, 4HR activates TGF-β/SMAD/VEGF signaling in endothelial cells and induced vascular regeneration and remodeling for wound healing."
276,Development and Application of Human Resources Opportunity Index (HROI): Indexing the Human Resource Opportunities in the Globalized Environment,나일주 /Ilju Rha,2009,한국방송통신대학교 원격교육연구소,"With increased exchange of human resources (HR) among countries, there has emerged an urgent need to identify the quality of HR in each country and to compare it with that of other countries from a global perspective. Developing an index which can be used both as a tool to identify the quality of HR at a national level and to make cross‐national comparisons would be an effective way to address this need. In order to accurately assess a nation‘s current state of the quality of its HR, the index should cover not only intellectual abilities of its HR but also their communication skills, attitudes and values, and other aspects. At the same time, the index should reflect features of today’s globalized labor environment to promote cross‐national comparisons. The present study is an attempt to meet global needs for such an index. 
The study consists of two parts: the first part comprises the development of an index which can assess the quality of a nation’s HR from a global perspective and the second part applies the index in measuring the quality of HR in 55 nations in pursuit of cross‐national comparisons. The index is named as the Human Resource Opportunity Index (HROI). 
To develop the index, well‐established existing indexes including the Digital Opportunity Index, the Growth Competitiveness Index, the Human Development Index, and the World Competitiveness Yearbook Index were extensively analyzed with regard to conceptual frameworks, specific measurement indicators and development procedures. Based on the analysis, HROI indicators were created and reviewed by experts in human resource development and training. The revised HROI indicators were then sent to a group of researchers in the HR field for confirmation. As a result, nine indicators in three categories were identified. 
This index was then applied to identify the HR opportunities of 55 nations. Quantitative data on the indicators were collected from official documents of several international organizations and governments and used to calculate the HROI of 55 countries. Using these HROI indices, cluster analysis was performed to identify major factors influencing the index scores, and correlation analysis was conducted to identify the concurrent validity of the index. The results demonstrated that intellectual property rights and overall productivity were the most influential indicators for HROI values. The concurrent validity was secured by the high correlations between HROI and other indices; GCI(.78), HDI(.80), and WCYI(.80). It is concluded that the HROI is a reliable and valid tool for measuring a nation's quality of HR.With increased exchange of human resources (HR) among countries, there has emerged an urgent need to identify the quality of HR in each country and to compare it with that of other countries from a global perspective.

본 연구는 두 부분으로 구성되어 있다. 전반부는 글로벌 관점에서 한 국가의 인적자원의 질을 평가할 수 있는 지수의 개발 자체에 대한 방법과 논리에 관한 것이고, 후반부는 국가 간 비교를 위하여 OECD 가입국 전체를 포함하는 55개국을 대상으로 이 지수를 산출함으로써 각 국가의 인적자원의 질을 평가하는 것이었다. 이 연구에서 사용된 지수는 인적자원개발지수(Human Resources 0pportunity Index: HROI)라고 명명되었다. 
전반부에서는 이 지수를 개발하기 위하여 개념적 틀, 구체적인 측정 지표, 개발 과정과 관련하여, 이미 잘 알려져 있는 지수인 Digital Opportunity Index, The Growth Competitiveness Index, the Human Development Index, the World Competitiveness Yearbook Index 등을 광범위하게 분석하였다. 이러한 분석에 기초하여, 개념적 틀과 측정지표를 개발하였고, 이 과정에서 인적자원 개발 및 교육 분야 전문가들의 검토 등 타당성을 확보하기 위한 노력을 하였다. 수차에 걸친 검토 과정을 통해 수정된 HROI 지표는 인적자원 분야의 연구자 그룹의 논의를 통해 최종 확정되었다.
후반부 연구인 적용단계에서는 55개국을 대상으로 인적자원 기회를 지수화 하였다. 지수계산에 사용된 양적 데이터는 여러 국제 기관과 정부의 공식적인 문서를 통해 수집하였다. 결과로 산출된 지수에 영향을 미치는 주요한 요인을 확인하기 위하여 군집분석이 수행되었고 지수에 대한 공인타당도를 확인하기 위해서 상관분석을 실시하였다. 그 결과 '영어능력', '인적자원 통합도', '전반적 생산성'이 HROI 평가에 있어 가장 영향력 있는 지수라는 것이 확인되었다. 공인타당도 확인을 위한 상관분석의 결과는 HROI와 다른 지수들(GCI(.78), HDI(.80), WCYI(.80)) 간 상관관계가 높은 것으로 나타났다. 
55개국 중에서 한국은 36위 (HROI 지수 0.41)인 것으로 나타났다. 드러난 지수들을 중심으로 몇가지 논의가 있었고 그 중 한가지 눈에 띄는 사항은 지적재산권이라는 항목이 HORI 선진국과 후진국을 구별하는 가장 중요한 요인이었다는 점이었다. 결론적으로 HROI는 국가의 인적자원의 질을 평가하고, 이에 대한 국가 간 비교를 위한 타당하고도 유용한 도구라고 결론지을 수 있었다.인적자원기회지수, HROI, 인적자원개발, 인적자원지수, 인적자원통계"

연구방법 : 한국과 일본의 제조업에 종사하는 근로자들을 대상으로 유의 표본추출(purposive sampling)법으로 자기기입식 설문지를 통해서 얻은 한국 292명, 일본 327명의 자료를 분석하였다.
연구결과 : SOC 전체와 하부영역인 처리가능성 및 유의미성에서 한국이 일본보다 높았으며, 유의한 차이가 있었다. HR-QOL 전체와 하부영역인 심리적인 영역 및 사회적인 영역에서 한국이 일본보다 높았으며, 유의한 차이가 있었다. 생활·건강만족도는 일본이 한국보다 높았지만, 통계적으로 유의한 차이가 없었다.
SOC, HR-QOL 및 생활·건강만족도의 상관관계에서 모두 유의하게 일본이 높았다. 구조모형에서는 생활·건강만족도가 HR-QOL에 미치는 영향은 한일 간 유의한 차이가 없었지만, HR-QOL이 SOC에 미치는 영향과 인과관계성은 일본이 한국보다 유의하게 높았다.
결론 : SOC는 한국이 일본보다 유의하게 높았다. 이는 한국 근로자가 일본 근로자 보다 건강행동을 잘 수행하며, 건강상태가 좋으며 정신적 건강이 더 양호하다고 할 수 있을 것이다. HR-QOL도 한국이 일본보다 유의하게 높았다. 이는 경제적으로 선진국인 일본이 한국보다 HR-QOL 낮다는 것은, HR-QOL에 미치는 영향이 경제적 측면보다는 사회문화적인 것이나 주관적인 측면이 더 많은 것으로 추측된다.
구조모형에서 SOC가 HR-QOL에 미치는 영향보다 HR-QOL이 SOC에 미치는 영향이 더 크게 나타나, 근로자의 건강유지능력과 스트레스대처능력을 높이고 정신 건강을 위해서는 한국과 일본 모두 HR-QOL을 향상시키는 산업보건 프로그램과 정책이 필요하다고 사료된다.Objective: This comparative study aims to evaluate the correlation and the differences of manufacturing workers in Korea and Japan, and to compare the causal relations among SOC, health related quality of life (HR-QOL) and Life-health satisfaction by structural equation model.
Methods: Present comparative study by purposive sampling analyzed the data collected from 292 manufacturing workers in Korea and 327 in Japan with Korean or Japanese self-reporting questionnaire distributed directly.
Results: Korea had significantly higher scores in total, manageability and meaningfulness of SOC, and in total, psychological and social portion of HR-QOL than Japan. Life-health satisfaction of manufacturing workers was higher in Japan than in Korea, but did not have a significant difference between Korea and Japan. Whereas Japan has significantly higher correlation in SOC, HR-QOL and Life-health satisfaction than Korea. From the point of the structural equation model, the impact of Life-health satisfaction on HR-QOL did not have a significant difference between Korea and Japan. Meanwhile, Japan had the significantly higher impact and causality of HR-QOL on SOC than Korea.
Conclusion: Korea had significantly higher scores in SOC. This might suggest that manufacturing workers in Korea conducted better health behaviors, had better health condition and was mentally healthier than those in Japan. Korea had also significantly higher scores in HR-QOL. This might suggest that HR-QOL was influenced more by sociocultural or subjective aspect than by economic aspect. In the structural equation model, the impact of HR-QOL on SOC was stronger than that of SOC on HR-QOL in both Korea and Japan. Thus, it can be suggested that various industrial health policy for HR-QOL of workers in both Korea and Japan is needed in order to keep healthy, to improve coping ability and to promote mental health.salutogenesis, sense of coherence(SOC), health related quality of life(HR-QOL), life-health satisfaction, Korea-Japan comparison"
278,Measurement of tensile strength of brittle rocks using a half ring shaped specimen,최병희 /Byung-Hee Choi,2019,한국지질과학협의회,"A tensile test using a half ring (HR) shaped specimen is attempted for the determination of the tensile strength of rock materials. The HR test is a 3-point bend test similar to the semicircular bend (SCB) test. However, the HR specimen is a curved prismatic bar. The theoretical tensile strength of this special bar can be obtained by an analytical formula derived from a basic theory of strength of materials. Owing to the eccentricity of the HR specimen, the possibility for a single tensile fracture to begin at the intended location can increase. This may give results that are more accurate than the conventional bending tests. In this paper, after the concept and formula of the HR test are introduced, its applicability to brittle rocks is investigated by FEM simulations and laboratory tests. In the processes, the theories of the Brazilian test and a special SCB test, which is an alternative to the Brazilian test, are used to examine the accuracy of the HR test."

281,Evaluation of Random Urine Sodium and Potassium Compensated by Creatinine as Possible Alternative Markers for 24 Hours Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion,구현민,2015,대한진단검사의학회,"Sodium and potassium intake was assessed on the basis of its respective excretion levels in 24 hr urine samples. However, owing to the inconvenience of collection, we evaluated random spot urine for alternative sodium and potassium excretion markers. We included 250 patients who submitted 24 hr- and spot urine for clinical tests. However, 22 patients who showed 24 hr urine creatinine excretion levels <500 mg/day were excluded, because these samples possibly resulted from incomplete urine collection. Moreover, 24 patients were excluded because of their use of diuretics during the urine collection period. We observed significant correlations between 24 hr urine sodium excretion and both the sodium/creatinine (r=0.34, P<0.0001) and the sodium/specific gravity unit (SGU) ratios (r=0.19, P=0.007) in random urine samples. Similarly, 24 hr urine potassium excretion and both the spot urine potassium/creatinine (r=0.47, P<0.0001) and potassium/SGU ratios (r=0.28, P<0.0001) were significantly correlated. Although the estimated sodium/creatinine and potassium/creatinine ratios showed a significant correlation with 24 hr urine sodium and potassium excretion, respectively, further studies are required to develop a spot urine test for individualized monitoring of sodium and potassium excretion."

Frontal brain asymmetry(FBA), heart rate(HR), respiratory sinus asymmetry(RSA), and skin conductance level(SCL) were recorded during baseline, relaxation, worry induction, anticipation of impromptu speech task and recovery. The relative left activation group showed lower distress rating than the right activation group at the end of the anticipation period and after the speech task. Participants with relatively higher left activation showed lower HR, and higher RSA than those with relatively higher right activation group during worry and anticipation task. The relatively higher right activation delayed recovery from higher HR and lower RSA due to speech task. Compared with baseline, relaxation increased left midfrontal cortex activity, but both worrying and anticipation decreased left midfrontal EEG activity. Worrying and anticipation was associated with greater HR, lower RSA and greater SCR compared with both baseline and relaxation. These findings support the role of FBA in the negative emotion regulation.

286,Very Long (> 48 hours) Shifts and Cardiovascular Strain in Firefighters: a Theoretical Framework,최봉규 /BongKyoo Choi,2014,대한직업환경의학회,"Shift work and overtime have been implicated as important work-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease(CVD). Many firefighters who contractually work on a 24-hr work schedule, often do overtime (additional 24-hrshifts) which can result in working multiple, consecutive 24-hr shifts. Very little research has been conducted onfirefighters at work that examines the impact of performing consecutive 24-hr shifts on cardiovascular physiology.
Also, there have been no standard field methods for assessing in firefighters the cardiovascular changes that resultfrom 24-hr shifts, what we call “cardiovascular strain”. The objective of this study, as the first step toward elucidatingthe role of very long (> 48 hrs) shifts in the development of CVD in firefighters, is to develop and describe a theoreticalframework for studying cardiovascular strain in firefighters on very long shifts (i.e., > 2 consecutive 24-hr shifts). Thedeveloped theoretical framework was built on an extensive literature review, our recently completed studies withfirefighters in Southern California, e-mail and discussions with several firefighters on their experiences of consecutiveshifts, and our recently conducted feasibility study in a small group of firefighters of several ambulatory cardiovascularstrain biomarkers (heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and salivary C-reactive protein).
The theoretical framework developed in this study will facilitate future field studies on consecutive 24-hr shiftsand cardiovascular health in firefighters. Also it will increase our understanding of the mechanisms by whichshift work or long work hours can affect CVD, particularly through CVD biological risk factors, and thereby informpolicy about sustainable work and rest schedules for firefighters."

The purpose of this study was both to research the effect of swimming on ST segment depression during treadmill exercise and to evaluate the cardiovascular risk and the annual mortality after swimming training. Subjects were 18 middle aged women who were 23-45 years old and healthy. During the graded treadmill exercise testing, ECG was recorded and analysed ST segment position at V2 and V5 leads and then adjusted by HR(ST/HR slop, ST/HR index). HR and SBP were increased by exercise intensity but increasing amounts were lower after training than before training. Exercise duration and maximal oxygen consumption were significantly(p<.05) increased after training. In V2 and V5 leads, ST segment were depressed by exercise intensity, but that deviation were decreased after training. ST/HR slop and index also decreased by exercise intensity, and ischemic symptom was diagnosed in ST/HR slop. Duke treadmill score was significantly(p<.05) increased after training, but annual cardiovascular mortality was significantly(p<.05) decreased after training.

289,터진고리 형태의 암석시편에 대한 인장강도 시험의 이론과 실제,최병희 /Byung-Hee Choi,2020,대한화약발파공학회,"본 연구에서는 암석의 인장강도를 측정하는 데 터진고리(split ring; SR) 형태의 시편(NX 코어)을 이용하는굽힘시험법의 적용성을 검토하였다. SR 시험법은 반고리(half ring; HR) 형태의 시편을 이용하는 HR 시험법(Choi et al., 2019)과 개념적으로는 동일하지만 파괴면이 하중방향과 직교하는 특징이 있다. 이 직교성 때문에 SR 시험법은 HR 시험법보다 더 높은 정확성을 발휘할 수 있을 것으로 예상되었다. HR 시편과 마찬가지로 SR 시편은 균일단면을 가진 굽은 각봉이다. 이 특수한 각봉의 이론적 인장강도는 재료강도학의 굽힘이론으로부터 계산할 수있다. 일련의 LS-DYNA 수치해석을 수행한 결과, 예상대로 인장형 및 압축형 SR 시험법의 강도오차는 1% 및 5% 로서 HR 시험법의 오차(12%)에 비해 매우 낮게 나타났다. 두 SR 시험법의 성능을 확인하기 위하여 실내실험을 실시하였다. 비교를 위하여 HR 시험과 Brazilian 시험도 함께 수행하였다. 실험 결과, Brazilian 강도에 대한 인장형 및압축형 SR 시험의 강도비는 각각 1.2∼1.4 및 1.1∼1.2로 나타났는데, 이는 통상적인 굽힘시험의 경험치에 비해 너무 작은 수치였다. 결과적으로 SR 시험은 NX 코어로 성형한 암석시편에 대해서는 실용성이 없는 것으로 판단하였다. 반면, HR 시험의 강도비는 선행연구와 본 연구를 통해 1.7~2.0의 범위에 속하여 높은 일관성을 보였다.In this study the split ring (SR) test was investigated for its applicability to the measurement of the tensile strength of rock specimen of NX size. The concept of the SR test is the same as the half ring (HR) test (Choi et al., 2019) except that the expected fracture plane is perpendicular to the loading direction. Because of this perpendicularity, however, it was believed that the SR test could be more accurate than the HR test. Like the HR specimen, the SR specimen is a curved prismatic bar with a uniform section. Appealing to a basic bending theory in strength of materials, the tensile strength for the special bar can be calculated analytically. Numerical simulations using LS-DYNA revealed, as expected, that the strength errors were 1% and 5% for the tensional and compressional SR tests, respectively, which were much lower than that (12%) of the HR test. To identify the performance of the two SR tests, laboratory experiments were conducted. The HR and Brazilian tests were also performed for comparison. The experiments showed that the ratios of the tensional and compressional SR to Brazilian strengths were 1.2∼1.4 and 1.1∼1.2, respectively, which are too small compared to empirical values in ordinary bend tests. Consequently, it is concluded that the SR test is not appropriate for use in tensile strength test of rock specimen of NX size. But the ratio of the HR to Brazilian strengths was within 1.7~2.0 for both the previous and present studies, showing a good consistency in their test results.Split ring (SR) test, Half ring (HR) test, Brazilian test, Tensile strength, Rock specimen, LS-DYNA"

Subjects were 7 women in the 50’s, treated by the different temperature of 3 groups, as normal temperature(23±1℃), cold temperature(6±1℃), hot temperature(32±1℃) during treadmill exercise and effects on changes of BNO, BP and HR have been evaluated. For statistical significance, we use repeated measured ANOVA. Main results of the present study were as followings: 1)BNO did not show significance among normal, cold and hot group. 2)The effects of on elderly women’s systolic blood pressure(SBP) was a significant difference by exercise time(p<.05). 3)Diastolic blood pressure(DBP) in all groups decreased at post-exercise more than pre-exercise and increased at recovery. Also, DBP was a significant difference by exercise time(p<.05) and between groups(p<.05). 4)HR was a significant difference by exercise time(p<.05) and between groups(p<.05), and the interaction was significant at the level of p<.05. To conclude, BNO contributes to blood endothelial cell relaxation, vasodilation and inhibition of pressor effect and it has a high relation with high blood pressure. These results may suggest that temperature has an influence on the BNO production and therefore leads to changes of BP and HR."

Experimental participants were classified into secure, fearful/avoidant, preoccupied and avoidant attachment style by the Relationship Questionnaire. During resting baseline, frontal brain asymmetry(FBA), heart rate(HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia(RSA) were recorded. After each 60 sec. rest period, self-reported emotional arousal and pleasantness, FBA, HR, and RSA were analysed while participants watched video-clips inducing happiness, fear and sadness with attachment-related content. At baseline, secure group showed higher left midfrontal activation than avoidant group and showed higher RSA than both fearful/avoidant and preoccupied groups. Secure individuals displayed higher arousal feelings, higher left midfrontal activation, lower HR and higher RSA to emotional video clips. Fearful/avoidant individuals responded to emotional stimuli with higher arousal feelings and higher right midfrontal activation and responded to negative stimuli with higher HR and lower RSA. Preoccupied individuals reported higher aroused subjective experiences to emotional stimuli and showed higher left midfrontal activation, higher HR and RSA to happiness clip, whereas opposite FBA and RSA patterns were observed in response to fear clip. Avoidant individuals responded to fear stimuli with lower arousal feelings, higher left midfrontal activation, and lower HR. These results suggest that attachment experiences could influence individual variability in emotion regulation and modulate underlying neurophysiological processes including FBA and vagal tone.attachment style, secure, fearful/avoidant, preoccupied, avoidant, FBA, HR, RSA"

The worldwide prevalence is highest for the HPV 16 and 18 genotypes, but HPV 52 and 58 have the highest prevalence in Asian countries, including Korea. The purpose of this study was to obtain basic data for the prevention of cervical cancer by analyzing the prevalence of HPV and the genotypes of high risk-human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection in women in Busan, Korea. We analyzed 1,995 cases of HPV in women who visited a Busan obstetrics and gynecology hospital from January 2016 to December 2017. The prevalence of HPV among these women was 28.3% (565/1995), and the HR-HPV infection rate was 75.4% (426/565). The HR- HPV genotype with the highest prevalence was HPV-52 (63/565, 11.2%), followed by HPV-58 (56/565, 9.9%), HPV-53 (55/565, 9.7%), and HPV-16 (53/565, 9.4%). The HR-HPV infection rate of young women 18-39 years old was 60.3% (257/426), so this age group should undergo continuous monitoring. The cytological results revealed a high infection rate for HPV-16 in high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, further evaluation of more samples is needed to confirm the HR-HPV genotypes related to the development of cervical epithelial neoplasias."
293,"Observation of Secondary Organic Aerosol and New Particle Formation at a Remote Site in Baengnyeong Island, Korea",최진수,2017,한국대기환경학회,"To improve the understanding of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from the photo-oxidation of anthropogenic and biogenic precursors at the regional background station on Baengnyeong Island, Korea, gas phase and aerosol chemistries were investigated using the Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) and the Aerodyne High Resolution Time of Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS), respectively. HR-ToF-AMS measured fine particles (PM1; diameter of particle matter less than 1 μm) at a 6-minute time resolution from February to November 2012, while PTR-ToF-MS was deployed during an intensive period from September 21 to 29, 2012. The one-minute time-resolution and high mass resolution (up to 4000 m Δm-1) data from the PTR-ToF-MS provided the basis for calculations of the concentrations of anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) including oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs). The dominant BVOCs from the site are isoprene (0.23 ppb), dimethyl sulphide (DMS, 0.20 ppb), and monoterpenes (0.38 ppb). Toluene (0.45 ppb) and benzene (0.32 ppb) accounted for the majority of anthropogenic VOCs (AVOCs). OVOCs including acetone (3.98 ppb), acetaldehyde (2.67 ppb), acetic acid (1.68 ppb), and formic acid (2.24 ppb) were measured. The OVOCs comprise approximately 75% of total measured VOCs, suggesting the occurrence of strong oxidation processes and/or long-range transported at the site. A strong photochemical aging and oxidation of the atmospheric pollutants were also observed in aerosol measured by HR-ToF-AMS, whereby a high f44 : f43 value is shown for organic aerosols (OAs); however, relatively low f44 : f43 values were observed when high concentrations of BVOCs and AVOCs were available, providing evidence of the formation of SOA from VOC precursors at the site. Overall, the results of this study revealed several different SOA formation mechanisms, and new particle formation and particle growth events were identified using the powerful tools scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), PTR-ToF-MS, and HR-ToF-AMS."

297,Simplified criteria for finite element modelling of European preloadable bolts,Mario D’Aniello,2017,국제구조공학회,"High strength preloadable bolt assemblies are commonly adopted in beam-to-column bolted connections. Nowadays, two systems of high strength preloadable grade 10.9 bolt assembly are recommended in Europe for structural applications, namely HR and HV, which are characterized by different failure modes. Recently, experimental tests performed on HR and HV bolt assemblies highlighted that the type of bolt assembly may significantly influence the joint response. Therefore, the accuracy of numerical modelling of bolt assemblies is crucial to simulate effectively the non-linear behaviour of bolted joints with either failure mode 2 or mode 3 of the bolt rows. In light of these considerations, this present paper describes and discusses some modelling criteria for both HR and HV bolts to be implemented in 3D finite element models by finite element analysis and structural designers. The comparison between the calibrated models and experimental results shows the accuracy of the proposed assumptions in simulating all stages of assembly tensile response."

ubiquitin gene promoter and the effects of conserved motifs, such as TAAG, TATA, and CAAT, along with
baculovirus enhancer homologous region 3 (hr3), on promoter activity. Ubiquitin gene of BmNPV was expressed
during the late phase of virus infection. In the presence of viral factors, significant reduction of
promoter activity was observed by deletion of -382 to -124 bp upstream of ATG. The fragment between
-187 and -383 bp upstream of ATG, including distal TAAG, CAAT motif, and TATA box, could also drive
expression of the reporter gene. The mutation of cis-elements TATA boxes and TAAG motifs significantly
decreased the promoter’s activity, while CAAT mutations enhanced promoter activity by 2- or 3-fold, as
compared with the native promoter. In the presence of BmNPV, hr3, both located downstream of the reporter
gene of the same vector, and separate vector, could significantly enhance transcription activity of ubiquitin
promoter as compared to the control. We concluded that BmNPV ubiquitin gene might be regulated by
dual sets of promoter elements, where TAAG and TATA box may positively regulate the expression of
ubiquitin, while CAAT motif functions as a negative regulator. Viral factor(s) play an important role in

The fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of HR-TEM image of annealed CuInSe2 nanoparticles illustrates that the particles have quasisingle crystal tetragonal structure, as also confirmed by the XRD pattern. The HR-TEM image clearly shows the fringe widths are in order without any defect with 0.32 nm. Microstructural analysis results clearly indicate that the synthesized and air-annealed nanoparticles are in highly crystalline state with near stoichiometric atomic composition."

분석 결과에 나타난 주요 발견들은 다음과 같다. 첫째, 기업여건 및 시장여건 등의 경영여건은 고용조정 만족도에 영향을 미치지 않는 것으로 나타났다. 이는 소극적 고용조정과 적극적 고용조정이 혼재되었음을 나타낸다고 볼 수 있다. 둘째, HR 부서가 중요한 역할을 수행하는 사업체는 그렇지 않은 사업체보다 높은 만족도를 보였다. 이러한 점들은 고용조정의 시행시 신중히 사전에 계획되어야 한다는 것과 HR 부서의 역할이 성공적인 고용조정에서 중요한 역할을 수행한다는 것을 시사한다.This paper investigates the effect that downsizing has on facilities's satisfaction, using KLI panel data. The empirical work are focusing on the determinants of downsizing satisfaction of facilities which implemented downsizing. Drawing on the relevant literature, two hypotheses are developed and tested.
The findings of the study are follows : First, the management circumstance such as facilities condition and market condition did not affect the downsizing satisfaction.

because they affect both strand of DNA. DSBs result in cell death or a genetic alterations including deletion, loss of heterozygosity, translocation,
and chromosome loss. DSBs arise from endogenous sources like metabolic products and reactive oxygen, and also exogenous factors like ionizing
radiation. Defective DNA DSBs can lead to toxicity and large scale sequence rearrangement that can cause cancer and promote premature aging.
There are two major pathways for their repair: homologous recombination(HR) and non-homologous end-joining(NHEJ). The HR pathway is a
known“ error-free”repair mechanism, in which a homologous sister chromatid serves as a template. NHEJ, on the other hand, is a“ error-prone”pathway,
in which the two termini of the broken DNA molecule are used to form compatible ends that are directly ligated.
This review aims to provide a fundamental understanding of how HR and NHEJ pathways operate, cause genome instability, and what kind of
genes during the pathways are associated with head and neck cancer."
303,Relationship between Bunkie-Test and Some Specific Physiological Indicators in Rugby Players,Ngayimbesha Adrien,2012,국민체육진흥공단 한국스포츠정책과학원,"The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the Bunkie-test performance and physiological indicators in rugby players. Participants were recruited from rugby clubs of Burundi participating in regional competition but not at elite level. Thirty three (33) players, age 19±2 years, height 1.86±0.08 (m) and weight of 88,6±13.5kg have participated in the present study. Three functional lines (medial stabilizing line, posterior stabilizing line and lateral stabilizing line) of isometric Bunkie-test have been performed. For the physiological indicators, maximal oxygen uptake (VO_(2max)), pulmonary ventilation (VE) and maximal heart rate (HR_(max)) have also been assessed using motor- driven treadmill. The independent t-test has been used for measurements comparison between groups. Spearman correlation has been also calculated and significant was set at p<0.05. Results show a very weak correlation between Bunkie-test and physiological indicators on some line positions: medial stabilizing line versus HR_(max) (r=0.32; p＜0.01), posterior stabilizing line versus VO_(2max) (r=0.26; p＜0.01) and posterior stabilizing line versus HR_(max) (r=0.27; p＜0.04). Other line positions have presented a very strong negative correlation between the Bunkie-test and physiological indicators. These lines are medial stabilizing line versus VO_(2max) (r=-0.34; p＜0.03); lateral stabilizing line versus VO_(2max) and lateral stabilizing line versus HRmax with respectively correlation value r=-0.35; p＜0.01 and r=-0.32; p＜0.01. Based on the findings of this study, the Bunkie-test cannot be a useful tool for evaluating rugby players on their cardio-respiratory fitness."

In order to fulfill the purpose of the study, this study used P300 component of ERPs and N2 component that became to affect influences to the information treating process such as brain’s perception, recognition, and inference. Through the research analysis, this study reached the following conclusions : First, as the result of this research, RPE and HR of adult males rose to the total exhaustion during sports accomplishment, and HR, blood lactate, temperature were raised significantly compared to pre-exercising, and then reached to the recovery stage while being lowered gradually. Second, Though P300 amplitude was lowered significantly right before exercising compared to pre-exercising, it was recovered to pre-exercising stage as time went by. Like this, functional decreases of the information treating process are caused as much as adults do high-intensity exercises that reach to the total exhaustion or time becomes longer right after sports accomplishment. However, HR, blood lactate, and temperature become to be recovered to the pre-exercising state with the passage of time. Therefore, it is considered that the differences of recovery time after doing high-intensity exercises affect influences to the central nervous system."

Studies have reported apparently positive association between HRM and various outcomes. Yet, it is not clear how and why the relationship exists. This paper provides an extensive theoretical review and explanation of the association. Specifically, this paper describes three key areas that are closely related to the topic. These are the relationship between HRM system and firm performance; variety of performance measures; HR outcomes as mediating variable that unveils mechanism known as “black box.” It is suggested that longitudinal approach and qualitative method are required in order for sophisticating the current research area of strategic human resource management (SHRM). The paper proposes an integrated model that theoretically accounts for the association and some related issues of SHRM. The model underscores HRM outcomes to understand how HRM impacts on performance. Also it is emphasized that the measures of performance in terms of stakeholder’s perspective should be taken into consideration for broadening and expanding the current research of SHRM. A number of conclusions can be drawn from this literature review of current issues of SHRM. In researching the association between HRM system or practices and firm performance, it is suggested that qualitative perspective should be applied in order to gain a broader understanding of SHRM; a longitudinal research plays an essential role in solving some issues unsolved so far, e.g. mechanism between HRM and performance and reverse causality, as well; along with the methodological issues, this study also emphasized the need for an integrated research model for carrying out further exploration. The issues suggested can be a useful framework for developing issues surrounding HRM and firm performance.SHRM, HR Practices, Mediators, Performance"

Organics and ammoniated sulfate were dominant species in NR-PM1. The organics was found to have similar fractions (approximate 40%) of NR-PM1 during the summer and winter, while the sulfate fractions of NR-PM1 were calculated to be approximately 47% and 31% for the summer and winter, respectively, suggesting the possibility that particles provide non-acidic surfaces for condensation of nitric acid in the winter. The nitrate fractions of approximate 4% and 20% of NR-PM1 were observed in August (summer) and November (winter), respectively, resulting that the relatively low concentration of sulfate in NR-PM1 provided a non-acidic surface for nitric acid condensation and formation of particulate ammoniated nitrate is favored thermodynamically in winter.
The new particle formation (NPF) event and particle growth rate were analyzed for each month in 2014 using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). The Percent of NPF events was the highest in winter, but NPF event was not observed during summer due to relatively high temperature and frequent rainfall. The average particle growth rate was 3.5 nm/h and the highest particle growth rate was 5.5 nm/h in May. We observed the long-range transport of the anthropogenic sulfate from the East Asia during the intensive monitoring period of November between Qingdao and Baengnyeong Island in 2013. The relatively high concentrations of m/z 60 measured in HR-ToF-AMS was observed in May and June at Baengnyeong Island, suggesting the possibility of the influence of biomass burning from the East Asia to the Korean Peninsula."
312,Increased productivity of the baculovirus expression vector system by combining enhancing factors,이지훈 /Ji-Hoon Lee,2018,한국응용곤충학회,"The baculovirus expression vector system uses the polyhedrin promoter for the expression of foreign proteins. To increase the polyhedrin promoter activity, vectors were constructed by combining two transcription enhancers and the vp39 promoter. The transcription enhancers included homologous region 5 (hr5) and burst sequences (BSs). Seven vectors were constructed using combinations of these transcription enhancers, and their expression levels were compared in Autographa californica multicapsid nuclepolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and Bombyx mori NPV (BmNPV) using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Our results indicate that most of the constructs increased the expression level of EGFP using the polyhedrin promoter. In particular, the vp39 promoter and BSs were the most effective in BmNPV and AcMNPV, respectively. Synergistic effects of the enhancing factors were observed only in AcMNPV by the vp39 promoter and BSs. The hr5 negatively affected the expression level of EGFP using the polyhedrin promoter and other enhancers in both viruses. The enhancing effect obtained by combining the three factors was higher in BmNPV than in AcMNPV. This was the first study to perform a comparative evaluation of enhancing factors that affect the expression efficiency of foreign protein using the polyhedrin promoter in both AcMNPV and BmNPV."

The size of dots formed on the surface is uniform but the density increases with the addition of In_(0.1_Ga_(0.9)As underlying between In_(0.5)Ga_(0.5)As QDs and GaAs buffer layer. This is consistent with the TEM characterization. The existence of thin underlying layer has caused the dots to have different crystal orientation as shown in TEM characterization. From the HR-XRD characterization, broad peak of In0.1Ga0.9As underlying layer and QDs has been observed. The wider width of the layer peak than the expected one has been attributed to the strain-relaxation-induced defects. The growth of a thin In_(0.1)Ga_(0.9)As underlying layer in the In_(0.5)Ga_(0.5)As/GaAs structures strongly affects the structural properties, which was also believed to influence the optical properties of QDs."

본 연구의 논의는 두 부분으로 나뉘어 진행된다. 첫번째 부분에서는 킹즈 칼리지 예배당 (King's College Chapel)의 역사와 헨리 8세와의 관계를 요약한 후 중세 교회건축의 상징론과 연관하여 예배당의 기본구조와 장식의 배치를 살펴본다. 두번째 부분에서는 첫 번째 부분의 논의 성과에 근거하여 루드 스크린(rood screen)의 HR 양각과 헨리 8세의 정치관을 분석하고 관련된 유사 사례로서 1538년 헨리의 명에 따라 발간된 대성서(Great Bible)에 표지에 나타난 이미지를 분석한다. 이를 통해 근대 영국사에서 정치적으로 가장 격동기 중 하나로 분류되는 헨리 8세 시기의 정치언설과 문화에 대해 보다 풍부한 상을 얻으려한다.The English Reformation, which Henry VIII triggered with the Acts of Supremacy (1534) served to strengthen his power. He put forward a radical contention that the King is the sole head of The Church of England. He endeavored to propagate and impress this concept of the king's power supremacy in the minds of his nobles and people, manifesting his concept of the kingship both as the head of the secular government and as the church in the many opportunities available to him. This study focuses on the cases visualizing t he concept, the letters 'HR' on the rood screen of the King's College Chapel and analyzes how they embody Henry's idea of kingship and political power.
The following discussion proceeds through two phases. The first part will briefly sketch the history of the King's College Chapel and its relationship to Henry VIII and discuss the church symbolism incorporated in the chapel's structure and decorations.

In this study, we took samples from various locations of PM emitted from the training ship (T/S) HANBADA’s main engine, in cooperation with the Korea Maritime and Ocean University. We analyzed the structure and characteristics of these samples using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and applied our findings as fundamental research for developing PM reduction technology. We also employed our results to determine appropriate preemptive action to meet upcoming PM/BC regulations. In addition, we confirmed the emission trend of pollutants from exhaust gases under various engine operating conditions using an exhaust gas analyzer. Results obtained from the analysis of HR-TEM images showed that the structure of the PM is chain-like wispy agglomerates consisting of a number of individual spherical particles. As the sampling location was moved away from the turbo charger (T/C) towards the funnel, more condensates were observed at a low temperature and the molecular structure of the PM lost its characteristic BC structure as an amorphous structure gradually appeared. Furthermore, through the analysis of exhaust gases, we predicted a decrease in PM concentration in the exhaust stream as engine rpm increase.Exhaust gas, Particulate matter, Black carbon, Structure, High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy"
318,An Empirical Study on the Relationship between Employment Flexibility and Business Strategy towards Small and Mid-sized Enterprises,이을터 /Eulteo Lee,2016,한국산업경영학회,"This study zeroed in on the labor force’s numerical adjustment and on human resource functionality, suggesting the factors that contribute to the attainment of employment flexibility, such as business strategies (cost reduction and innovation), company size, and labor union, and determining how employment flexibility and performance are related to each other at the firm level.
For the survey results, it was found that overall, the SMEs that adopted an innovation strategy as well as relatively larger enterprises work proactively to realize HR functionality, such as by hiring based on meritocracy, investing in employee training, managing based on objectives, and pegging the annual pay of employees based on their performance, practices that boost performance. On the other hand, it was found that the SMEs that adopted a cost reduction strategy tended to hire non-regular workers to achieve labor cost savings but did not go to the extent of pursuing numerical adjustment in terms of HR management, such as declaring redundancies, laying off workers, and restructuring the workforce. It was shown in this study, however, that the companies without labor unions could numerically re-arrange or adjust their workforce by laying off workers."

With its characteristics such as future orientation, data diversity, and context dependency, workforce analytics can be useful for organizations in creating values.
However, workforce analytics also entails potential problems coming from indifference to strategic elements, low predictive validity, and privacy invasion and ethical violation. Based on these aspects, suggestions are given for the effective implementation of workforce analytics.
Specifically, we propose the following: (1) the establishment of an organization’s HR digital agenda; (2) the pursuit of convergence between academia and practice; (3) the initiation of analytics based on right and important business questions; (4) the enhancement of HR professional’s analytical competence and business understandings; (5) the change management to mitigate organizational resistance to an analytics mind-set. Finally, it is also reminded that organizations need to pursue people-centered workforce analytics, rather than being buried in ever-increasing data or falling into the trap of analysis paralysis, to create values.Workforce analytics, HR analytics, people analytics, talent analytics, HR digital transformation, Industry 4.0, strategic human resource management"

Eight male collegiate students participated in an exercise trial(EX) and a control trial(CON). In the EX, they ran for 30 minutes at 70% of their VO2max, and then rested for 10 hours. In the CON, they rested for 30 minutes instead of the exercise. A liquid meal was provided at 2 hour of the recovery phase for two trials. Oxygen consumption(VO2), HR, skin temperature, and RER were measured and compared between the trials. Main results were as follows: 1) There were significant differences between EX and CON in VO2 from immediately after the trial to 7 hours of recovery. 2) There were significant differences between EX and CON in HR from immediately after the trial to 6 hours of recovery. 3) RER was significantly lower in EX than CON throughout the recovery. 4) Increment in VO2 by having a meal was greater in EX than CON. It was concluded that the duration of EPOC was 7-8 hours when complicated by having a meal and the magnitude of EPOC was about 32 L, indicating 28.53% of net exercise VO2. In addition, the exercise caused an enhancement of TEM. A bout of submaximal exercise would be clinically important by increasing EPOC and TEM during recovery."

322,한국 시큐리티영역 확대를 위한 드론 활용방안,곽원석 /Gwak Won Seok,2020,한국응용곤충학회,"Baculovirus expression systems (BESs) have been used to express many foreign proteins. BESs are known to be very suitable for foreign protein production due to the strong gene expression ability of the polyhedrin promoter.
However, expression of foreign proteins using the polyhedrin promoter begins at a very late phase, in the last stage of viral infection. This causes insufficient production of foreign proteins due to death of the host cells.
Therefore, our study aimed to construct a vector that can enable not only earlier production of foreign recombinant proteins but also increased production. For this purpose, a novel overexpression vector based on the polyhedrin promoter was constructed by using transcriptional enhancers (hr3 and repeated burst sequences (BSs)) and an additional promoter capable of inducing earlier gene expression than the polyhedrin promoter.
Among the vectors with additional promoters that were evaluated, the overexpression vector with the p6.9 promoter showed the highest foreign protein expression efficiency. This vector showed approximately 94 times greater and one-day-earlier expression of the foreign protein than the control vector containing only the polyhedrin promoter. In order of greatest to least influence, the factors that increased the expression efficiency of the polyhedrin promoter were the repeated BSs, the p6.9 promoter and hr3."

The chemical composition of NR-PM1 in Baengnyeong island was dominated by organics and sulfate in the range of 36~38% for 3 years, and the organics were the dominant species in the range of 44~55% of NR-PM1 in Seoul metropolitan area. The sulfate was found to be more than 85% of the anthropogenic origin in the both areas of Baengnyeong and SMA. Ratio of gas to particle partition of sulfate and nitrate were observed in both areas as more than 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, representing potential for formation of additional particulate sulfate and nitrate. The high-resolution spectra of organic aerosol (OA) were separated by three factors which were Primary OA (POA), Semi-Volatility Oxygenated Organic Aerosol (SV-OOA), and Low-Volatility OOA (LV-OOA) using positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis. The fraction of oxygenated OA (SOA, ≒OOA=SV-OOA +LV-OOA) was bigger than the fraction of POA in NR-PM1. The POA fraction of OA in Seoul is higher than it of Baengnyeong Island, because Seoul has a relatively large number of primary pollutants, such as gasoline or diesel vehicle, factories, energy facilities. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis revealed that transport from eastern China, an industrial area with high emissions, was associated with high particulate sulfate and organic concentrations at the Baengnyeong and SMA sites.

333,The impact of TQM practices on employee satisfaction in the ICT customer service and retail distribution organizations,황기현 /GeeHyun Hwang,2015,대한설비관리학회,"Employee satisfaction is one of the most essential tasks for ICT service industry because it significantly affects service quality, customer satisfaction, finally firm profitability. However, the effect of HR-focused total quality management(TQM) on employee satisfaction has not been examined in the ICT service supply chain organizations. The principle of TQM stresses continuous improvement which needs the involvement of every employee in the organization. This study aimed to investigate critical factors of TQM practices that would positively affect employee satisfaction. Data for this study were collected from ICT service company, which have implemented TQM program for more than ten years. Data were analyzed using the multiple regression methodology. The results suggest that five constructs of TQM practices have a positive effect on employee satisfaction. This study finally provides a basic guideline for managers in ICT customer service and retail distribution organizations, who desire to improve the level of employee satisfaction and service quality in their firms, through an effective TQM implementation."

338,Development of Continuous Galvanization-compatible Martensitic Steel,Y. F. Gong,2012,한국부식방식학회,"The development of martensitic grades which can be processed in continuous galvanizing lines requires the reduction of the oxides formed on the steel during the hot dip process. This reduction mechanism was investigated in detail by means of High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) of cross-sectional samples. Annealing of a martensitic steel in a 10% H2 + N2 atmosphere with the dew point of -35 ℃ resulted in the formation of a thin c-xMnO.SiO2 (x>1) oxide film and amorphous a-xMnO.SiO2oxide particles on the surface. During the hot dip galvanizing in Zn-0.13%Al, the thin c-xMnO.SiO2 (x>1)oxide film was reduced by the Al. The a-xMnO.SiO2 (x<0.9) and a-SiO2 oxides however remained embedded in the Zn coating close to the steel/coating interface. No Fe2Al5-xZnx inhibition layer formation was observed.
During hot dip galvanizing in Zn-0.20%Al, the c-xMnO.SiO2 (x>1) oxide film was also reduced and the amorphous a-xMnO.SiO2 and a-SiO2 particles were embedded in the Fe2Al5-xZnx inhibition layer formed at the steel/coating interface during hot dipping. The results clearly show that Al in the liquid Zn bath can reduce the crystalline c-xMn.SiO2 (x>1) oxides but not the amorphous a-xMnO.SiO2 (x<0.9) and a-SiO2oxides. These oxides remain embedded in the Zn layer or in the inhibition layer, making it possible to apply a Zn or Zn-alloy coating on martensitic steel by hot dipping. The hot dipping process was also found to deteriorate the mechanical properties, independently of the Zn bath composition."
339,Indium Composition Dependence of Raman Spectroscopy and Photocurrent of InxGa1-xAs Strained Layers Grown by Using MOCVD,S. Kang,2020,한국물리학회,"The photocurrent and Raman were studied for the InxGa1-xAs strained layers grown on GaAs (001) substrates by using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with different indium compositions. The indium composition in the InxGa1-xAs strained layers was determined by using high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) and Vegard's rule. The in-plane lattice constants and tensile strains of the InxGa1-xAs strained layers were evaluated as functions of the indium composition. The tensile strain of the InxGa1-xAs strained layers increases as the indium composition increases. The Raman spectra are observed to be dominated by the GaAs longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode as the strongest peaks show up around 287~292 cm-1. Moreover, the weak and broad spectral features in the range of 265~270 cm-1 originate from the peaks associated with the GaAs transverse optical (TO) phonon mode.
The Raman peak also shifts toward lower wave number with increasing indium compositions, which indicates the presence of tensile strain in the InxGa1-xAs layers. As the indium composition increases, the band-gap shift decreases for temperatures ranging from 30 to 300 K."

In this study, we assume that the relationship between the pay dispersion and the corporate financial performance is a linear U-shaped curved relationship, which is out of the conventional literature. In other words, although the pay dispersion up to a certain level has a positive effect on the motivation of the members, the excessive pay dispersion encourages the morale of the members, which ultimately deteriorates the financial performance of the organization. Also the effect of the pay dispersion can be varied according to the context. Therefore, we want to explore the interaction effect between talent management system, corporate performance pay, and pay competitiveness in terms of HR internal fit perspective.

For achieving this purpose, 8 active male students were performed.
This experiment was carried out with three times repetition. Subjects were asked to maintain three postures in bending angles from 45 to 90 degrees, performing the exercise at a same time. For measuring the exercise load(EL), we used the HR checker(Polar RS800CX, Finland) and EMG(LXM3204, Korea) in order to earn the maximum voluntary isometric contraction(MVIC) value of 4 target muscles, subjects pedaled for 60 seconds at 70 rpm on 3 sitting posture respectively. ‘TeleScan’ software program was used to analyze the values of muscle activity for earning the MVIC. These values were calculated, analyzed using oneway analysis of variance(oneway ANOVA) to detect significant differences by SPSS/PC ver. 24.00. Statistical significance was defined as p<.05. The data of three postures suggested that only RF values in accordance with three postures showed significant differences statistically(p<.05). In case of ES, its posture more contributed to RF than the other postures did during cycling. Also, this study demonstrated that no matter what postures subjects biked in, four target muscles have significant differences in muscle activity(p<.001). As this study showed RF and GL had a main role and rest of muscles supported to main muscles.

While metabolic syndrome is associated with sympathetic overactivity, little is known about the relationship between metabolic syndrome and HR recovery. A symptom-limited exercise stress test in healthy subjects (n=1,434) was used to evaluate HR recovery. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program’s Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP-III) criteria. Seventeen percent of subjects had ≥≥3 criteria for metabolic syndrome. HR recovery was lower in men than women and in smokers than nonsmokers. The subject with metabolic syndrome (vs. without) showed lower HR recovery (10.3 ±±11.6 vs. 13.6 ±±9.7 per minute) and higher resting HR (64.3 ±±10.3 vs. 61.6 ±±9.1 per minute). HR recovery correlated inversely to age (r=-0.25, p<0.0001), but not to resting HR or maximal oxygen uptake. Delayed HR recovery was associated with metabolic syndrome after an adjustment for age, sex, resting HR and smoking (p<0.01). Metabolic syn-drome is associated with impaired vagal reactivation. Adverse cardiovascular out-comes associated with metabolic syndrome may be mediated by the failure of vagal reactivation in addition to sympathetic overactivity.Heart Rate; Heart Rate Recovery; Metabolic Syndrome X; Vagal Reactivation"

The hair follicle (HF), a small independent organ of the skin, resides in the epidermis and undergoes regenerative cycling for normal hair formation.
HF development requires many genes and signaling pathways to function properly in time and space, one of them being the HR gene. Various mutations of the HR gene have been reported to cause the hair loss phenotype in rodents and humans. In recent studies, it has been suggested that the HR gene is a critical player in the regulation of the hair cycle and, thus, HF development.
Furthermore, the HR gene is associated with the Wnt signaling pathway, which regulates proliferation and differentiation of cells and plays an essential role in hair and skin development. In this review, we summarize the mutations responsible for human hair disorders and discuss the roles of the HR gene in HF development."

As a result, NCc-HR having changes in color differences (ΔE) increased with longer deposition time in case of using alum.
In case of using tannin, dyes not containing tannin showed the least color differences (ΔE), while those containing it tended to show an increase in color differences (ΔE) with longer deposition time for dyeing. NCc-30HR using 0.7 g alum and NCc-30HR using 0.1 g tannin showed good shampoo fastness.Color difference (ΔE), Human hair dyeing, Shampooing fastness, Turmeric"
356,Human Papillomavirus Prevalence and Genotype Distribution in Normal and ASCUS Specimens: Comparison of a Reverse Blot Hybridization Assay with a DNA Chip Test,김성현 /Kim， Sunghyun,2015,대한의생명과학회,"High-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes are strongly associated with cervical cancer, whereas otherHPV genotypes are not. To identify the various HPV genotypes in clinical samples, we conducted HPV genotyping usinga DNA chip test and reverse blot hybridization assay (REBA) in normal cytology samples and atypical squamous cellsof undetermined significance (ASCUS) cytology samples. We also investigated the HPV infection rate and HPV genotypeprevalence in women with normal cytology and ASCUS cytology. Liquid-based cytology preparations were used forthe initial screening of 205 subjects with normal cytology and ASCUS cytology. The HPV infection rate was 49.8%when using the DNA chip assay and 61.0% when using the REBA test. In patients with normal cytology, the HR-HPVpositive rate was 21.9% with the DNA chip assay and 43.9% with the REBA test. In contrast, 8.3% of patients withASCUS were HR-HPV positive when using the DNA chip assay, and 13.6% were positive when tested with the REBAtest. The infection rate of HR-HPV in the 40~50-year age group was significantly higher than that of the other age groups.
Based on the cytological analysis of the normal and ASCUS samples, the five most prominent HPV genotypes were HPV16, 18, 68, 33, and 58 using the DNA chip test, and they were HPV 16, 18, 53, 33, and 66 when using the REBA test. Inconclusion, the findings show that the results of the REBA test are comparable to those of the DNA chip test. Moststrikingly, the REBA test detected the HR-HPV genotype associated with cervical carcinoma similar to that detected withthe DNA chip method. Therefore, the REBA test is a useful method to detect clinically important HR-HPV genotypes."
357,Cellular Dynamics of Rad51 and Rad54 in Response to Postreplicative Stress and DNA Damage in HeLa Cells,최의환 /Eui-Hwan Choi,2017,한국분자세포생물학회,"Homologous recombination (HR) is necessary for maintenance of genomic integrity and prevention of various mutations in tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes. Rad51 and Rad54 are key HR factors that cope with replication stress and DNA breaks in eukaryotes. Rad51 binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to form the presynaptic filament that promotes a homology search and DNA strand exchange, and Rad54 stimulates the strand-pairing function of Rad51. Here, we studied the molecular dynamics of Rad51 and Rad54 during the cell cycle of HeLa cells. These cells constitutively express Rad51 and Rad54 throughout the entire cell cycle, and the formation of foci immediately increased in response to various types of DNA damage and replication stress, except for caffeine, which suppressed the Rad51-dependent HR pathway. Depletion of Rad51 caused severe defects in re-sponse to postreplicative stress. Accordingly, HeLa cells were arrested at the G2–M transition although a small amount of Rad51 was steadily maintained in HeLa cells. Our results suggest that cell cycle progression and proliferation of HeLa cells can be tightly controlled by the abundance of HR proteins, which are essential for the rapid response to postreplicative stress and DNA damage stress."

Healthy volunteers who planned to drive a long distance were recruited and monitored with a 24-hour Holter. Six healthy volunteers were enrolled. Their mean driving time was 297.7 ± 111 minutes. Mean duration of sleepy time while driving was 27 ± 24.5 minutes. Driving HR showed a trend for increment as compared to day time mean HR, from 85 ± 5.6 to 89.8 ± 5.6 beats/min (by 7%) (P = 0.093). Mean HR while sleepy driving significantly decreased to 81.5 ± 9.2 beats/min by 9.3% ± 7.4% (P = 0.046).
This pilot study for the first time demonstrated that HR decreased while sleepy driving."

360,Biofuntional Nanoparticle Formation and Folate-Targeted Antitumor Effect of Heparin-Retinoic Acid Conjugates,오인혁,2012,한국고분자학회,"Heparin–retinoic acid (HR) and heparin–folic acid–retinoic acid (HFR) amphiphilic bioconjugates were synthesized for the development of an actively targeted drug delivery system for cancer therapy. The HR and HFR bioconjugates were synthesized by chemical conjugation via amide linkages of the carboxyl groups of heparin and the amine groups of aminated retinoic acid (RA) and aminated folic acid (FA). The chemical structures of HR and HFR were confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The coupling ratio of RA to heparin could be modulated by varying the feed molar ratio of RA to heparin. In aqueous media, HR and HFR bioconjugates self-aggregated to form nanoparticles through the hydrophobic RA interactions. The size, critical aggregation concentrations, and morphologies of HR and HFR nanoparticles were evaluated using dynamic light scattering, fluorescence spectrophotometry,and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The sizes of the HR and HFR nanoparticles ranged from 80 to 220 nm according to the coupling ratio of RA. In vitro experiments showed that the HFR nanoparticles selectively recognized a folate receptor-positive cancer cell line (KB cells) and displayed higher cytotoxicity compared to free RA and HR nanoparticles. This enhanced cytotoxicity was not observed in folate receptor-negative A549cells. In a human tumor xenograft nude mouse model, HFR nanoparticles reduced the tumor volume compared to HR nanoparticles or free RA without any signs of toxicity. These results proved that HFR nanoparticles have great potential for cancer targeting and treatment."
361,Heart rate is associated with mortality in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy,"이수진 /Lee, Soojin",2017,대한신장학회,"Background: Heart rate (HR) is an essential vital sign based on the finding that HR beyond its normal range is associated with several conditions or diseases, including high mortality in several clinical settings. Nevertheless, the clinical implications of HR remain unresolved in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 828 patients who underwent CRRT due to acute kidney injury between 2010 and 2014. HR and other baseline parameters at the time of CRRT initiation were retrieved. The odds ratio (OR) of 30-day mortality was calculated using a multivariate logistic model. Results: CRRT significantly lowered the HR of patients such that the pre- and post-CRRT HRs (average 6 hours) were 107 beats/min and 103 beats/min, respectively (P < 0.001). When we explored the relationship with 30-day mortality, only HR at the time of CRRT initiation, but not pre- or post-CRRT HR, had a significant relationship with mortality outcome. Based on this result, we divided patients into quartiles of HR at the time of CRRT initiation. Mortality OR in the 4th quartile HR group was 2.6 (1.78-3.92) compared with the 1st quartile HR group. This relationship remained consistent despite adjusting for 28 baseline covariates: OR, 1.7 (1.09-2.76); P = 0.020. However, HR was not associated with the weaning rate from CRRT. Conclusion: High HR at the time of CRRT initiation is subsequently related with high mortality. These results can be a basis for a future predictive model of CRRT-related mortality."
362,Prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus and its genotype distribution in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas,김유일 /Yuil Kim,2020,대한병리학회,"Background: High-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) is found in a subset of head and neck (HN) squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). For oropharyngeal SCCs, HR HPV positivity is known to be associated with good prognosis, and a separate staging system for HPV-associated carcinomas using p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a surrogate test has been adopted in the 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. We examined the HR HPV status and the genotype distribution in five HN subsites. Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were used for p16 IHC and DNA extraction. HPV DNA detection and genotyping were done employing either a DNA chip-based or real-time polymerase chain reaction–based method. Results: During 2011–2019, a total of 466 SCCs were tested for HPV DNA with 34.1% positivity for HR HPV. Among HN subsites, the oropharynx showed the highest HR HPV prevalence (149/205, 75.1%), followed by the sinonasal tract (3/14, 21.4%), larynx (5/43, 11.6%), hypopharynx (1/38, 2.6%), and oral cavity (1/166, 0.6%). The most common HPV genotype was HPV16 (84.3%) followed by HPV35 (6.9%) and HPV33 (4.4%). Compared with HR HPV status, the sensitivity and specificity of p16 IHC were 98.6% and 94.3% for the oropharynx, and 99.2% and 93.8% for the tonsil, respectively. Conclusions: Using a Korean dataset, we confirmed that HR HPV is most frequently detected in oropharyngeal SCCs. p16 positivity showed a good concordance with HR HPV DNA for oropharyngeal and especially tonsillar carcinomas. The use of p16 IHC may further be extended to predict HR HPV positivity in sinonasal tract SCCs."
363,Mapping Quantitative Trait Loci for Awnness and Yield Component Traits in Isogenic Lines Derived from an Oryza sativa/O. rufipogon Cross,Feng-Xue Jin,2009,한국작물학회,"An advanced backcross line, HR9118, was produced from a single plant of BC3F3 families derived from a cross between Oryzarufipogon Griff. (IRGC 105491) as a donor parent and the O. sativa subsp. japonica cv. Hwaseongbyeo as a recurrent parent.
Although HR9118 resembled Hwaseongbyeo, several traits were different from those of Hwasoengbyeo, including days to heading,plant height, and awn. These differences between Hwasongbyeo and HR9118 could be attributed to introgressed O. rufipogon chromosomesegments into HR9118. Introgression analysis using 460 SSR markers revealed that three O. rufipogon-specific chromosomesegments were detected in HR9118 genome. F2:3 populations derived from the cross between Hwaseongbyo and HR9118, consistingof 340 F2 plants and 137 F3 lines, were used to map and characterize QTLs for 12 traits. QTL analysis identified a total of 17QTLs in the F2:3 populations. Of these, seven QTLs were shared by the F2 and F3 populations, whereas the other ten QTLs were identifiedonly in the F3 population. In seven (41.2%) QTLs identified in this study, the O. rufipogon-derived alleles contributed desirableagronomic effects despite the overall undesirable characteristics of the wild phenotype. Each of three O. rufipogon introgressed segmentscontained multiple QTLs, indicating linkage and/or pleotropic effects. A cluster of eight QTLs was detected on chromosome 8including a major QTL for awn. Substitution mapping using F2 population indicated that awn8 was located within an intervalbetween two SSR makers RM23326 and RM23356 which are 590 kb apart. SSR markers tightly linked to QTLs for yield componentsdetected in this study will facilitate cloning of the gene underlying this QTL as well as marker-assisted selection for variationin grain weight in an applied breeding program."
364,How to Perform and Interpret a High-resolution Anorectal Manometry Test,이태희 /Taehee Lee,2016,대한소화기 기능성질환∙운동학회,"High-resolution anorectal manometry (HR-ARM) and high-definition anorectal manometry (HD-ARM) catheters have closely spaced water-perfused or solid state circumferentially-oriented pressure sensors that provide much better spatiotemporal pressurization than non-high resolution catheters. This is a comprehensive review of HR-ARM and HD-ARM anorectal manometry catheter systems, the methods for conducting, analyzing, and interpreting HR-ARM and HD-ARM, and a comparison of HR-ARM with non-high resolution anorectal manometry. Compared to non-high resolution techniques, HR-ARM and HD-ARM studies take less time and are easier to interpret. However, HR-ARM and HD-ARM catheters are more expensive and fragile and have a shorter lifespan. Further studies are needed to refine our understanding of normal values and to rigorously evaluate the incremental clinical utility of HR-ARM or HD-ARM compared to non-high resolution manometry."
365,Distribution of Oncogenic Human Papillomavirus Genotypes at High Grade Cervical Lesions above CIN 2 Grade with Histological Diagnosis,김지혁 /Kim Geehyuk,2016,대한의생명과학회,"High risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is major risk factor for uterine cervical cancer. There are approximately 15 types of HR-HPV. Liquid based cytology samples (116 samples) with high grade cervical lesions belonging to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, CIN 3, carcinoma in situ (CIS) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were used after histologic confirmation. HR-HPV genotype assay was conducted using DNA chips. The HR-HPV infection rate was 81.9% with SCC samples showing the highest HR-HPV infection rate of 31%. CIN 3, CIS and CIN 2 showed infection rates of 25%, 16.4% and 9.5%, respectively. According to age with HR HPV infection rate, the 30~39 years-old group showed the highest infection rate by 92.3%. According to distribution with HR HPV genotyping, HPV 16 showed the highest infection rate by 42.3% whereas HPV 33 and HPV 58 showed infection rates of 11.7% and 10.8%, respectively. HPV 18 which is the second most common infected HPV genotype in the world showed 3.6%. Of the three most common oncogenic HR-HPV genotypes in CIN 2, we detected HPV 16, 35, 58; CIN 3 was HPV 16, 33, 58; CIS was HPV 16, 58, 33 (35/52); and SCC was HPV 16, 33, and 18 (31/52/58). Among the HPV 18, CIN 2, CIN 3, CIS and SCC showed 0.9%, 0.9%, 0% and 1.8%, respectively. The most often used preventive vaccines for cervical cancers use HPV 16 and HPV 18 as targets. However, results derived from this study suggest that a preventive vaccine against HPV 16 and HPV 18 would not be optimal for populations in this study."
366,인사관리제도 번들(bundle)과 조직성과에 관한 연구,전경주,2006,대한경영학회,"Previous research examining human resource (HR) practices and organizational performance had mainly focused on testing relationship between organizational performance and a single human resource practice. However, examining the relationship using a single practice gives an unbalanced perspective on HR practices and performance. By broadening the research and including many potentially relevant variables, we can gain a better and clearer insight. A “bundle” of practices interact with individual organizational members’ behaviors to produce changes in motivation, which, then, can lead to greater individual performance and, ultimately, increase organizational performance. In this paper, a large array of human resource (HR) practices is used to examine organizational performance. The data consists of organizations of diverse industries. First, I will discuss the measures of HR practices found in the survey data, and assess how they cluster, or produce discrete groups of organizations in the data set. Next, I will examine how the practices relate to organizational performance by testing the hypothesis about whether there is a positive relationship between organizational performance and organizations that have used the practices. The result generally supports the hypothesis.본 연구에서는 다양한 인사관리제도를 묶어서 조직의 성과를 알아보고자 한다. 과거 연구에서는 한 가지의 인사관리제도를 사용해 조직의 성과를 알아보았지만, 그것은 한면만 고려한 좁은 시각에서 바라보는 것이기 때문에 다양한 인사관리제도의 통합적인 영향을 알아볼 필요가 있는 것이다. 단 한 가지가 조직성과에 영향을 주지 않듯이 여러 종류의 인사관리제도를 묶어서 보면 더 나은 그리고 더 넓은 이해를 얻을 수 있다고 본다. 본 연구에서는 다양한 인사관리제도 뿐만 아니라 다양한 한국기업들을 관찰하였다. 한국기업들이 기존의 인사관리제도의 틀에서 벗어나 새로운 인사관리제도를 채택한 결과 조직에 어떤 성과를 주었는지를 살펴보았다. 군집분석을 통해 인사관리제도의 활용에 따라 기업들을 배열하고 분석하였다. 결론은 대체로 새로운 인사관리제도를 채택한 조직들이 성과도 높았다는 것이다.인사관리제도, 번들, 조직성과"
367,Expression of CHOP in Squamous Tumor of the Uterine Cervix,추현희,2012,대한병리학회,"Background: High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection and abnormal p53 expression are closely involved in carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) of uterine cervix. Recent studies have suggested that virus-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress modulates various cell survival and cell death signaling pathways. The C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is associated with ER stress-mediated apoptosis and is also involved in carcinogenesis of several human cancers. We hypothesized that CHOP is involved in the carcinogenesis of uterine cervical cancer in association with HR-HPV and/or p53. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze CHOP and p53 protein expression of tissue sections from 191 patients with invasive cancer or preinvasive lesions of the uterine cervix (61 cases of SqCC, 66 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] III, and 64 cases of CIN I). Results: CHOP was expressed in 59.4% of CIN I, 48.5% of CIN III, and 70.5% of SqCC cases. It was also significantly more frequent in invasive SqCC than in preinvasive lesions (p=0.042). Moreover, CHOP expression significantly correlated with HR-HPV infection and p53 expression (p=0.009 and p=0.038, respectively). Conclusions: Our results suggest that CHOP is involved in the carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix SqCC via association with HR-HPV and p53."

One-step acid hydrolysis의 경우, 120oC에서 HR 4% 고형분을 2% 황산 용액에 넣어 1시간 동안 반응시킬 경우가 적정하였다. Two-step acid hydrolysis의 적정조건은 1차 가수분해시 HR 건조중: 72% 황산을 1 g : 1.5mL로 하여 60oC에서 1시간 반응시킨 다음, 증류수 23.5 mL를첨가하고 120oC에서 1시간 가수분해시키는 것이었다.

Glucose 생성량, 발효억제물질(HMF, furfural) 생성량, 강산 사용제한 등을 종합적으로 감안할 때, combined hydolysis가 보다 유용할 것으로 판단되었다.To explore hydrolysis methods for the efficient manufacture of sugar solutions from the freshwater alga Water-net (Hydrodictyon reticulatum, HR), acid hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, and combined hydrolysis (acid followed by enzymatic hydrolysis) were investigated. In the one-step acid hydrolysis, the reaction of 8% solids content using 2% sulfuric acid at 120oC for 1 hour was desirable. In this case, glucose 27.44 g 100 g DM-1 could be obtained from the HR-d13 samples. In the two-step acid hydrolysis, the primary hydrolysis (HR powder : 72% sulfuric acid = 1 g : 1.5 mL) was carried out for 1 hour at 60oC, and then the secondary hydrolysis was done for 1 hour at 120oC after addition of distilled water 23.5 mL. In this case, glucose 35.11 g/100 g DM could be obtained from the HR-d13 samples. In the combined hydrolysis, 25% solids content using 2% hydrochloric acid were reacted for 1 hour at 120oC, and then citrate buffer and hydrolysis enzyme complexes (E1 1.0 mL+E2 0.2 mL g-1 dried matter) were added and reacted for 1 – 2 days at 50oC. In this case, glucose 33.5 g 100 g DM-1could be obtained from the HR-d23+26 samples. In conclusion, combined hydrolysis was likely to be more useful saccharification method of HR biomass at a practical level, considering the glucose productivity, generation of fermentation-inhibiting substances(hydroxyl methyl furfural, furfural), and limited use of strong acid.Acid hydrolysis, Freshwater algae, Hydrodictyon reticulatum, Saccarification"

Moreira,2019,사단법인약침학회,"The increased resting heart rate (HR) in heart transplant patients is associated with enhanced metabolic demand, the potential for fatigue, and lower quality of life. In the present study, we hypothesized that transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) could modulate autonomic balance and reduce resting HR in these patients. A single-arm clinical trial was conducted with patients aged > 18 years, at ambulatorial accompaniment after heart transplantation, who were submitted to a single TEAS (40 minutes at pericardium channel acupoints PC5 and PC6). The arterial blood pressure and RR interval were recorded from 20 minutes before to 20 minutes after TEAS. The RR intervals were used to calculate HR variability (HRV) and the sympathovagal index. Linear mixed models were used for comparing variables before, during, and after TEAS. The significance level was set as P < 0.05. TEAS acutely improved HRV in transplant patients and enhanced the sympathovagal index during its application. Significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were observed at recovery, such as a slight, but significant, decrease in HR. In conclusion, TEAS at PC5 and PC6 acutely modulates HRV and hemodynamics in transplant patients."
371,Characteristics and Treatment Outcomes of Isoniazid Mono-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Retrospective Study,곽세현 /Se Hyun Kwak,2020,연세대학교의과대학,"Purpose: Isoniazid (INH) mono-resistant tuberculosis (Hr-TB) is a highly prevalent type of drug-resistant TB, possibly associatedwith unfavorable treatment outcomes. However, definitive guidelines on an optimal treatment regimen and duration for Hr-TBare currently under discussion. We evaluated the characteristics and treatment outcomes of Hr-TB patients.
Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of Hr-TB patients treated at a South Korean tertiary referralhospital from January 2005 to December 2018.
Results: We included 195 Hr-TB patients. 113 (57.9%) were male, and the median age was 56.6 [interquartile range, 40.2–68.6]years. Mutations in katG were the most frequent [54 (56.3%)], followed by those in the inhA [34 (35.4%)]. Favorable and unfavorableoutcomes were noted in 164 (84.1%) and 31 (15.9%) patients, respectively.

Conclusion: A tailored strategy targeting high-risk patients is imperative for improved treatment outcomes. Further research onthe rapid and accurate detection of resistance to INH and other companion drugs is warranted."
372,간세포암 환자에서의 간절제술,황신 /HWANG， SIN,2013,대한의사협회,"For single hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), hepatic resection (HR) is regarded as the treatment of choice regardless of size when hepatic function is preserved. Systematic HR is preferred,but an individual patient-customized treatment plan for HR is essential to ensure patient safety as well as to achieve oncologic curability. HR can offer an acceptable survival outcome for patients with small oligo-nodular HCCs and well-preserved liver function. For HCC patients with portal vein tumor thrombus, HR with thrombus removal can lead to improved outcomes comparing with non-surgical treatments. Liver transplantation (LT) is a treatment that offers a chance of a cure for HCC and the underlying liver cirrhosis simultaneously, but the availability of liver grafts and the aggressi-veness of tumor recurrence are critical limiting factors of LT for patients with HCC. In Korea, the shortage of deceased donors and strong demand for LT has led to the development of living-donor LT. Considering that HCC recurrence is the most common cause of post-transplant patient death, recipient candidates should be prudently selected through objectively established criteria. The eligibility criteria for LT for HCC are likely to be expanded, but this will require further qualified risk-benefit analyses. HR and LT have complementary roles; thus they should be considered associated treatments rather than mutually exclusive alternatives. A multi-modality treatment strategy, especially for patients with advanced HCC, provides new fields of investigation for diverse indications of HR and LT.Hepatocellular carcinoma, Hepatectomy, Liver transplantation, Recurrence, Hepatic failure"
373,발효 당용액 생산자원으로서 담수조류 그물말의 유용성,김슬기,2012,한국잡초학회,"본 연구에서는 담수녹조류인 그물말(Hydrodictyon reticulatum, HR)을 산업바이오 자원으로서 활용하는방안을 강구하고자 일차적으로 효소당화의 용이성을검토하였다. HR에 대하여 효소당화를 2% 고형분 함량에서 동일조건으로 수행했을 때, 다른 종류의 바이오매스(Spirulina, Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Cladophora,Corn stover)보다 glucose 수득율이 가장 높았다. HR을분말화하지 않아도 최적조건의 효소처리량에서 당화가 모두 이루어지며, HR 당화용액의 citrate buffer strength가 0.1mM까지 낮아도 당수득율에 큰 지장이없었다. 또한 HR을 고온의 전처리없이 실온상태에서바로 당화시켜도 120℃ 처리에 비해 10% 미만의 당화율 감소만 나타내었다. 발효균주의 일반적인 생장적온인 37℃ 또는 pH 6.5에서도 당화가 정상적으로 잘 일어나 당화/발효를 동시에 진행시킬 수 있는 바이오매스로의 특징을 보였다. 효소량을 기준량의 1/10정도줄여도 최적조건의 70～80%에 해당하는 glucose 수득율을 나타내었다. 그리고 본 실험조건에서 HR의 고형분 함량 10%까지 당수득율이 떨어지지 않았고 15%이상되어야 감소하기 시작하여 고농도 당용액 생산에도 좋은 특성을 나타내었다. 이들의 제반 결과는 HR 이 당화가 매우 쉽게 일어나는 특징을 가진 조류 바이오매스임을 나타내준다. 이러한 장점뿐만 아니라 수집하기가 매우 용이한 사상조류(flilamentous algae)이기때문에 다른 종류의 조류 바이오매스에 비해 바이오화학제품 생산을 위한 원료로서 향후 이용가치가 매우높을 것으로 판단된다.To investigate the usefulness of freshwater alga Water-net (Hydrodictyon reticulatum, HR) as resources for production of fermentable sugars, the easiness of enzymatic saccharification was evaluated at first. When 6 plant materials (HR, Spirulina, Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Cladophora, Corn stover) were enzymatically hydrolyzed with 2% solid loading at the same condition, HR showed the highest ratio of saccharification based on glucose production. No milled HR was also completely saccharified at the amounts of optimal enzyme mixture. Glucose yield was not changed though the citrate buffer strength for saccharification was decreased from 0.1 M to 0.1 mM. Only about 10% yield reduction was observed compared to that of 120℃ treatment when HR was enzymatically hydrolyzed at room temperature. The saccharification was normally occurred at 37℃ and pH 6.5 which is general growth condition of fermentable microrganisms, suggesting that HR have a biomass characteristics applicable for the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. The saccharification was occurred by more than 70～80%of one of the best condition although the supplied enzyme amounts was reduced to 1/10 volume. And the glucose yield by enzymatic hydrolysis was not decreased by 10% HR solid loading and began to decrease at more than 15% solid contents. Above these results show that HR is an interesting algal biomass which is relatively easy to be saccharified by hydrolyzing enzymes. In addition, HR is a flilamentous alga and very easy to be collected. Therefore, HR seems to be an useful and valuable resources in the economical production of fermentable sugars for manufacture of bio-chemical products."

Thirty PD patients were assigned to HR for 9 weeks. At the end of this training, all patients were evaluated again and results of basal vs. final evaluations were compared.Results At final evaluation, the group assigned to HR showed significantly larger amplitude of the first ‘e’ in the phrase, larger signature surface area, and superior margin. A trend of increase in letter size was also observed. Handwriting with progressively decreasing size of letters and ascending direction with respect to the horizontal were prominent findings in both groups of patients and they did not change after HR.Conclusion Rehabilitation programs for handwriting problems in PD patients are likely to be helpful. Larger randomized studies are needed to confirm these results."
375,Germline and somatic mutations in homologous recombination genes among Chinese ovarian cancer patients detected using next­generation sequencing,Qianying Zhao,2017,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: To define genetic profiling of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency inChinese ovarian cancer patients.
Methods: We have applied next-generation sequencing to detect deleterious mutationsthrough all exons in 31 core HR genes. Paired whole blood and frozen tumor samples from50 Chinese women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian carcinomas were tested to identify bothgermline and somatic variants.
Results: Deleterious germline HR-mutations were identified in 36% of the ovarian cancerpatients. Another 5 patients had only somatic mutations. BRCA2 was most frequentlymutated. Three out of the 5 somatic mutations were in RAD genes and a wider distributionof other HR genes was involved in non-serous carcinomas. BRCA1/2-mutation carriers hadfavorable platinum sensitivity (relative risk, 1.57, p<0.05), resulting in a 100% remissionprobability and survival rate. In contrast, mutations in other HR genes predicted poorprognosis. However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that platinum sensitivity andoptimal cytoreduction were the independent impact factors influencing survival (hazardsratio, 0.053) and relapse (hazards ratio, 0.247), respectively.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that a more comprehensive profiling of HR defect thanmerely BRCA1/2 could help elucidate tumor heterogeneity and lead to better stratification ofovarian cancer patients for individualized clinical management.."
376,Phenotyping analysis of p53 knockout mice produced by gene editing and comparison with conventional p53 knockout mice,김욱진 /Ukjin Kim,2019,한국유전학회,"Background Knockout (KO) mice developed by homologous recombination (HR) have become useful tools to elucidate gene function. However, HR has low KO efficiency and is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. ‘Gene editing’ has received much attention for efficient genetic manipulation.
Objective As generation of KO mice is simplified, KO mice produced by HR can be feasibly reproduced using gene editing.
However, phenotyping analysis and comparison between KO mice produced by these two techniques is necessary.
Methods We generated p53 KO mice through gene editing and compared their phenotype with the already reported HRmediated p53 KO mice.
Results Tumors occurred in 36 (73%) of 49 homozygous KO mice and the mean age of occurrence was 23 weeks, with lymphoma (64%) and sarcoma (23%) being the most common. Tumors were also developed in 12 heterozygous mice and the mean age of occurrence was 40 weeks, with sarcoma (54%) and lymphoma (46%) in high proportion. Homozygotes had a mean life span of 157 ± 52 days and developmental abnormalities were found in females compared to in males (P < 0.05, P < 0.001).
Conclusion We analyzed the basic phenotype of p53 KO mice and observed no significant difference from the conventional HR-mediated p53 KO mice."
377,Analysis of Correlation between Heart Rate and Pulse Wave Velocity using Cardiovascular Simulator,Lee Min-Woo,2020,한국물리학회,"In clinical studies, the effect of heart rate (HR) alone as feedback for maintaining homeostasis cannot be observed. Therefore, in this study, the effect of HR on pulse wave velocity (PWV) was investigated using a simulator without feedback. This was achieved via a one-tube model that simplifies the human arterial system and an arterial tree model similar to the human body, using a cardiovascular simulator. The one-tube model measured the pressure waveform at two measuring points 1.2 m apart, while the arterial tree model measured the pressure waveform in the carotid and femoral arteries. In the one-tube experiment, the effects of HR, mean pressure (MP), and stroke volume (SV) on PWV were independently investigated. PWV was found to increase as HR increased, but was not affected when MP and SV were changed. Further, in the arterial tree model experiment, it was observed that the PWV increased with an increase in HR. The results of this study showed that even in a simulator containing a human arterial model made of silicone material with no human feedback action, changes in HR alone affect the PWV."
378,Parasympathetic Modulation Plays a Key Role in Initiation of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation,이원재,2007,영남대학교 의과대학,"Background: An acceleration or deceleration of the heart rate (HR), which reflects autonomic effects, is observed before the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). The purpose of this study was to assess the discrepancy in the autonomic interactions before the onset of PAF for different patterns of change in the HR.
Materials and Methods: From 105 Holter tapes with the PAF recorded, 55 episodes (42 patients, 34 men, 58±12 years) of PAF (>5 min), preceded by a sinus rhythm for more than 1 hour, were selected and submitted to time-domain and frequency-domain HR variability analyses. Fifty-five episodes were divided into 2 groups: group A PAF (n=30) with acceleration of the HR during the last 2 minutes before the PAF and group B (n=25) with deceleration of the HR.
Results: A significant linear decrease in the mean R-R interval was observed in group A (924±30 to 835±28 ms, P=0.001) and an increase from 831±32 to 866±31 ms in group B PAF episodes (P=0.046). In the frequency-domain analyses, the LF/HF ratio exhibited a progressive linear increase before the PAF in group A (P=0.005). The HF normalized units (HFnu) and natural logarithm-transformed HF (lnHF) values decreased from 30.8±4.0 to 16.1±1.8 (P=0.003) and 4.49±0.25 to 4.07±0.22 (P=0.001), respectively. Contrary to the results in group A, a significant increase in the HF components (HFnu and lnHF) (from 22.6±3.2 to 30.2±4.0, P=0.005, and 4.27±0.27 to 4.75 0.33, P=0.001, respectively) and a resultant decrease in the LF/HF ratio were observed in group B PAF episodes. No significant changes were observed in the LF components in either PAF group.
Conclusion: Autonomic stimuli leading to an acceleration or deceleration of the HR before the onset of AF are due to parasympathetic modulation. Parasympathetic modulation plays a key role in the initiation of PAF"
379,Can human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping classify non-16/18 high-risk HPV infection by risk stratification?,성연은 /Yeoun Eun Sung,2016,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: Infection with high-risk genotypes of human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is themajor cause of invasive cervical cancers. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are known to be responsiblefor two-thirds of all invasive cervical carcinomas, followed by HPV-45, -31, and -33.
Current guidelines only differentiate HPV-16/18 (+) by recommending direct colposcopy fortreatment. We tried to evaluate whether there are differences in risk among 12 non-16/18 HRHPVgenotypes in this study.
Methods: The pathology archive database records of 1,102 consecutive gynecologic patients,who had results for cervical cytology and histology and for HPV testing, as determined byHPV 9G DNA chip, were reviewed.
Results: Among the 1,102 patients, 346 were non-16/18 HR-HPV (+) and 231 were HPV-16/18(+). We calculated the odds ratios for ≥cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2) of 14groups of each HR-HPV genotype compared with a group of HR-HPV (−) patients. Based onthe odds ratio of each genotype, we divided patients with non-16/18 HR-HPV genotypes (+)into two groups: HPV-31/33/35/45/52/58 (+) and HPV-39/51/56/59/66/68 (+). The age-adjustedodds ratios for ≥CIN 2 of the HPV-31/33/35/45/52/58 (+) and HPV-39/51/56/59/66/68 (+) groupscompared with a HR-HPV (−) group were 11.9 (95% CI, 7.6 to 18.8; p<0.001) and 2.4 (95% CI,1.4 to 4.3; p<0.001), respectively, while that of the HPV-16/18 (+) group was 18.1 (95% CI, 11.6to 28.3; p=0.003).
Conclusion: The 12 non-16/18 HR-HPV genotypes can be further categorized (HPV-31/33/35/45/52/58 vs. HPV-39/51/56/59/66/68) by risk stratification. The HPV-31/33/35/45/52/58genotypes might need more aggressive action. Large scale clinical trials or cohort studies arenecessary to confirm our suggestion."
380,Impact of Heart Rate Reduction with Maximal Tolerable Dose of Bisoprolol on Left Ventricular Reverse Remodeling,최석원,2018,대한의학회,"Background: We aimed to evaluate effect of heart rate (HR) reduction on left ventricular reverse remodeling (LVRR) in Korean patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
Methods: Ambulatory patients with HFrEF, who had paired echocardiograms, N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and global assessment score (GAS) at baseline and 6-month (n = 157), were followed up on preset treatment schedule with bisoprolol.
Results: The LVRR occurred in 49 patients (32%) at 6-month. In multivariable analysis, independent predictors associated with LVRR were use of anti-aldosterone agent (odds ratio [OR], 4.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80–9.71), young age (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92–0.99), high baseline HR (OR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.40–10.10), and favorable baseline GAS (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.06–2.81). Beneficial effect of bisoprolol, in terms of LVRR, NT-proBNP, and GAS, was remarkable in the high HR group (baseline HR ≥ 75 beats per minute [bpm]), which showed a large HR reduction.
Conclusion: High baseline HR (≥ 75 bpm) showed an association with LVRR and improvement of NT-proBNP and GAS in patients with HFrEF. This seems to be due to a large HR reduction after treatments with bisoprolol. Trial registry at www.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00749034."

Materials and Methods: Of the 200 recruited patients, 100 underwent 16-slice MDCT (M:F=74:26, median age: 55.2 ± 12.8 years) and 100 underwent 64-slice MDCT (M:F=68:32, median age: 58.4 ± 11.6 years). We evaluated the image quality with respect to the HR and the variations in the HR. The images were graded in terms of the quality of vessel depiction with using a four-point scoring system from 1 to 4, where 4 represented the best image quality. In addition, we analyzed the 16- and 64-slice MDCT images in terms of the presence and frequency of stair-step artifacts. 
Results: The mean HR variation was significantly lower on 64-slice MDCT than that on 16-slice MDCT (5.48 ± 4.20 bpm vs. 10.31 ± 5.90 bpm, respectively, p < 0.05). The mean image quality score of 64-slice MDCT was significantly greater than that of 16-slice MDCT (3.40 ± 0.36 vs. 2.75 ± 0.43, respectively, p < 0.05).

We investigated the efficacy of combined aromatase inhibitor (AI) and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist in premenopausal patients with HR-positive MBC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 21 HR-positive premenopausal MBC patients treated with combined AI and LHRH agonist therapy. Results: The median follow-up period was 32.9 months. The overall response rate was 47.6%, with three complete responses (14.3%) and seven partial responses (33.3%). Nine patients (42.9%) achieved stable disease lasting more than 6 months; thus, the clinical benefit rate was 90.4%. The median time to progression was 45.4 months. No patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Conclusion: Combined AI and LHRH agonist treatment safely and effectively induced remission or prolonged disease stabilization, suggesting that this could be a promising treatment option for HR-positive premenopausal patients with MBC."
383,Assessing Accuracy of Wrist-Worn Wearable Devices in Measurement of Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia Heart Rate,Jongmin Hwang,2019,대한심장학회,"Background and Objectives: Wrist-worn wearable devices provide heart rate (HR) monitoring function via photoplethysmography technology. Recently, these devices have been used by patients to measure the HR when palpitation occurs, but few validation studies of these instruments have been conducted. We assessed the accuracy of these devices for measuring a HR.
Methods: This study enrolled 51 consecutive patients with a history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVT) or paroxysmal palpitations who were scheduled to undergo an electrophysiological study (EPS). Three devices were assessed: Apple Watch Series 2 (Apple), Samsung Galaxy Gear S3 (Galaxy), and Fitbit Charge 2 (Fitbit). Patients were randomly assigned to wear 2 different devices. The HR at baseline and induced SVT were measured during the EPS. After successful ablation of SVT, HR measurements was also done during atrial and ventricular pacing study.
Results: The mean patient age was 44.4±16.6 years and 27 patients were male (53%). The accuracy (within ±5 beats per minute [bpm] of an electrocardiogram [ECG] measurement) of the baseline HR measurements was 100%, 100%, and 94%, for Apple, Galaxy, and Fitbit, respectively. The HR during induced SVT ranged from 108 bpm to 228 bpm and the accuracy (within ±10 bpm of an ECG) was 100%, 90%, and 87% for the Apple, Galaxy, and Fitbit, respectively. During pacing study, accuracy of these devices was also acceptable but tended to decrease as the HR increased, and showed differences between the devices.
Conclusions: Wrist-worn wearable devices accurately measure baseline and induced SVT HR."

Performing artificial fertilization using frozen-thawed sperm, after freezing the sperm at different DMSO concentration of 5.0%, 7.5%, 10.0% respectively, FR were (DMSO 5.0%: 99.5±0.8%, DMSO 7.5%: 99.5±0.7%, and DMSO 10.0%: 99.6±0.6%). The results are not significantly different from the control fresh sperm (100%). HR also (DMSO 5.0%: 96.2±2.3%, DMSO 7.5%: 95.3±3.6%, 10.0%: 96.6±1.8%) were not significantly different in each group. The normal individual rate after hatching using with control fresh sperm (98.4%±0.5) and DMSO concentration level of 5.0% (97.8±0.1%) were not significantly different. However, with 7.5% (97.2±0.6%) and 10.0% DMSO concentrations (95.9±0.2%) are lower than the normal individual rate after hatching observed in the control and 5.0% DMSO. Performing artificial fertilization using frozen-thawed sperm at different frozen period (2 days, 2 years, and 3 years), 10% DMSO FR and HR of 3 years (FR; 66.8±1.8%, HR: 82.0±12.9%) and 2 years (FR; 78.5±14.8%, HR: 79.3±0.6%) cryopreserved sperm were lower than control (FR; 100%, HR: 91.1±3.6%) and 2 days cryopreserved sperm (FR; 99.6±0.6%, HR: 96.6±1.8%). These results suggest suitable DMSO concentration ranges of cryopreservation sperm for E. bruneus is 5 to 10% and with 2 to 3 years cryopreservation period, cryopreservation sperm can be useful for seed production."
385,High­risk human papillomavirus genotype distribution and attribution to cervical cancer and precancerous lesions in a rural Chinese population,Xue-Lian Zhao,2017,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: To explore the genotype distribution of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) and its attribution to different grades of cervical lesions in rural China, which will contribute to type-specific HPV screening tests and the development of new polyvalent HPV vaccines among the Chinese population.
Methods: One thousand two hundred ninety-two subjects were followed based on the Shanxi Province Cervical Cancer Screening Study I (SPOCCS-I), and screened by HPV DNA testing (hybrid capture® 2 [HC2]), liquid-based cytology (LBC), and if necessary, directed or random colposcopy-guided quadrant biopsies. HPV genotyping with linear inverse probe hybridization (SPF10-PCR-LiPA) was performed in HC2 positive specimens. Attribution of specific HR-HPV type to different grades of cervical lesions was estimated using a fractional contribution approach.
Results: After excluding incomplete data, 1,274 women were included in the final statistical analysis. Fifteen point two percent (194/1,274) of women were HR-HPV positive for any of 13 HR-HPV types (HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) and the most common HR-HPV types were HPV16 (19.1%) and HPV52 (16.5%). The genotypes most frequently detected in HR-HPV-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1) were HPV52 (24.1%), HPV31 (20.7%), HPV16 (13.8%), HPV33 (13.8%), HPV39 (10.3%), and HPV56 (10.3%); in HR-HPV-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+): HPV16 (53.1%), HPV58 (15.6%), HPV33 (12.5%), HPV51 (9.4%), and HPV52 (6.3%). HPV52, 31, 16, 33, 39, and 56 together contributed to 89.7% of HR-HPV-positive CIN1, and HPV16, 33, 58, 51, and 52 together contributed to 87.5% of CIN2+.
Conclusion: In summary, we found substantial differences in prevalence and attribution of CINs between different oncogenic HPV types in a rural Chinese population, especially for HPV16, 31, 33, 52, and 58. These differences may be relevant for both clinical management and the design of preventive strategies.."

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was waived. From July 2009 to February 2012, 145 consecutive patients with deep subcortical infarctions (SC-I, n = 81; LS-I, n = 64) who underwent HR-VWI were included in this study. The degree of MCA stenosis and the characteristics of MCA plaque (presence, eccentricity, location, extent, T2-high signal intensity [T2-HSI], and plaque enhancement) were analyzed, and compared between SC-I and LS-I, using Fisher’s exact test.
Results: Stenosis was more severe in SC-I than in LS-I (p = 0.040). MCA plaque was more frequent in SC-I than in LS-I (p = 0.028), having larger plaque extent (p = 0.001), more T2-HSI (p = 0.001), and more plaque enhancement (p = 0.002). The eccentricity and location of the plaque showed no significant difference between the two groups.
Conclusion: Both SC-I and LS-I have similar HR-VWI findings of the MCA plaque, but SC-I had more frequent, larger plaques with greater T2-HSI and enhancement. This suggests that HR-VWI may have a promising role in assisting the differentiation of underlying pathophysiological mechanism between SC-I and LS-I."

In this study, we investigated the effects of pineapple fruit extract containing glucosylceramides (PFEG) on the maintenance and recovery of skin barrier function using atopic dermatitis-induced animal models. Five-week-old male Hos:HR-1 mice were divided into four groups fed on standard diet, unsaturated fatty acids-deficient (HR-AD) diet, and HR-AD diet supplemented with 0.01% or 0.1% pineapple-GluCer. Skin barrier function was evaluated by transepidermal water loss (TEWL), dermal moisture content, moisture content of the stratum corneum and wrinkle formation. The control group (HR-AD administration group) showed increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), while the epidermal moisture content and the moisture content of the stratum corneum slowly decreased. However, in the PFEG groups (with 0.1% or 0.01% glucosylceramide), the TEWL levels were significantly reduced at 2 weeks. The PFEG also helped maintain skin moisturizing function by significantly suppressing the decrease of the epidermal moisture content and the moisture content of the stratum corneum. These results show that the PFEG is effective for maintaining and improving the function of the skin barrier. Therefore, this study suggests that PFEG is a potential candidate material for skin functional foods."

These simulations improve on our previous Horizon Run 1 (HR1) up to a factor of 4.4 in volume, and range from 2600 to over 8800 times the volume of the Millennium Run. In addition, they achieve a considerably finer mass resolution, down to 1.25×10^(11)h^(−1)M_⊙, allowing to resolve galaxy-size halos with mean particle separations of 1.2h^(−1)Mpc and 1.5h^(−1)Mpc, respectively. We have measured the power spectrum, correlation function, mass function and basic halo properties with percent level accuracy, and verified that they correctly reproduce the ΛCDM theoretical expectations, in excellent agreement with linear perturbation theory. Our unprecedentedly large-volume N-body simulations can be used for a variety of studies in cosmology and astrophysics, ranging from large-scale structure topology, baryon acoustic oscillations, dark energy and the characterization of the expansion history of the Universe, till galaxy formation science – in connection with the new SDSS-Ⅲ. To this end, we made a total of 35 all-sky mock surveys along the past light cone out to z = 0.7 (8 from the HR2 and 27 from the HR3), to simulate the BOSS geometry.

390,The Effect of Low-Dose β-Blocker on Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability in Healthy Subjects with a Resting Heart Rate of Less than 65 Beats per Minute: Effect on the Image Quality of Prospective Electrocardiography-Gated Coronary CT Angiography,박철환 /CHUL HWAN PARK,2015,대한영상의학회,"Purpose: We assessed the effect of a low-dose β-blocker on heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV) and image quality of prospective electrocardiography-gated coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in healthy subjects with low HR.
Materials and Methods: CCTA was performed with a 64-slice CT in 75 subjects with a HR of less than 65 beats per minute (bpm). Subjects were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (G1), 35 with a low dose β-blocker; and Group 2 (G2), 40 without pre-medication. The image quality (IQ) of the CCTA was assessed on a 4-point grading scale (1, poor; 4, excellent).
Results: Initial HR (bpm) was not different between the 2 groups. HR during CCTA was lower in G1 than G2 (50.3 ± 5.6 vs. 53.3 ± 4.8, p = 0.016). HRV was not different between the 2 groups. Per-segment analysis showed better IQ at the mid-segment of the right coronary artery (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 2.5 ± 1.1, p = 0.039) and the first diagonal branch (3.4 ± 0.6 vs. 3.1 ± 0.7, p = 0.024), in the G1 than the G2 group, respectively. The IQ was negatively correlated with HR, but no correlation was found between HRV and IQ. The IQs in the per-vessel analysis were not different between the 2 groups.
Conclusion: Low-dose β-blocker reduced HR and improved the IQ of CCTA in a few segments, even at a HR of less than 65 bpm. However the effect was limited.목적: 저용량 베타차단제가 분당 65회 이하의 느린 심박수 무증상 환자에서, 전향적 동조화 심장 CT의 영상 질을 높일 수 있는지 알아본다.
대상과 방법: 심박수가 65회 이하인 무증상 환자 75명을 두 군으로 나누어 전향적 동조화 심장 CT를 시행하였다. 1군 35명은 검사 30분 전, 저용량 베타차단제를 구강투여 후 시행하였으며, 2군 40명은 투약 없이 시행하였다. 각 환자에서 검사 전 심박수, 검사 중 심박수, 검사 중 심박변화를 측정하였다. 심장 CT 관상동맥 각 분절마다 영상 질을 평가하여 1점에서 4점까지 점수를 매겼으며, 4점이 가장 좋은 영상을 의미하였다.
결과: 두 군의 검사 전 심박수는 차이가 없었다. 심장 CT 시행 중 평균 심박수(bpm)는 1군이 2군에 비해 유의하게 낮았으며(50.3 ± 5.6 vs. 53.3 ± 4.8, p = 0.016), 검사 중 심박변화는 두 군 간 차이가 없었다. 분절별 분석에서 1군의 우관상동맥 중분절(3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 2.5 ± 1.1, p = 0.039)과 좌전하행동맥 제1사선분절(3.4 ± 0.6 vs. 3.1 ± 0.7, p = 0.024)의 영상 질이 2군에 비해 유의하게 좋았다. 영상 질은 심박수와 음의 상관관계를 보였으나 심박변화와는 상관관계를 보이지 않았다. 혈관별 분석에서 영상 질은 두 군 간 차이가 없었다.
결론: 저용량 베타차단제는 느린 심박수 무증상 환자에서 심박수 감소효과가 있으며, 전향적 동조화 심장 CT 일부 분절의 영상 질을 높일 수 있으나, 그 효과는 제한적이다."
391,"Comparative evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and hemostatic effect of 2% lidocaine with various concentrations of epinephrine",Myong-Hwan Karm,2018,대한치과마취과학회,"Background: We evaluated the changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), and the anesthetic and hemostatic effects, after injection of 2% lidocaine containing various concentrations of epinephrine in rats and mice to determine the appropriate concentration of epinephrine in various anesthetic mixtures.
Methods: Rats and mice were randomly allocated to experimental groups: 2% lidocaine without epinephrine (L0), 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 (L200), 1:100,000 (L100), and 1:80,000 (L80). Changes in MAP and HR after administration of the anesthetic mixture were evaluated using a physiological recording system in rats. Onset and duration of local anesthesia was evaluated by pricking the hind paw of mice. A spectrophotometric hemoglobin assay was used to quantify the hemostatic effect.
Results: MAP increased in response to epinephrine in a dose-dependent manner; it was significantly higher in the L80 group than in the L0 group at 5 min post-administration. The HR was relatively lower in the L0 group than in the L80 group. The time required for onset of action was < 1 min in all evaluation groups. The duration of action and hemostatic effect of the local anesthetic were significantly better in the L200, L100, and L80 groups than in the L0 group.
Conclusion: L200 demonstrated relatively stable MAP and HR values with satisfactory efficacy and hemostatic effect. L200 might be a better local anesthetic for dental patients in terms of anesthetic efficacy and safety."
392,Effects of combining both mobilization and hold-relax technique on the function of post-surgical patients with shoulder adhesive capsulitis,정종찬 /Jongchan Jung,2020,물리치료재활과학회,"Objective: This study investigated the effects of combining both mobilization and hold-relax (HR) technique on the function of post-surgical patients with shoulder adhesive capsulitis.
Design: Randomized controlled trial.
Methods: Forty-five surgical patients with shoulder adhesive capsulitis participated in this study and were randomly divided into three groups; both mobilization with movement (MWM) and HR technique (HR-MWM) group (n=15), the MWM group (n=15), and control group (n=15). All participants received three different interventions; 1) MWM combined with HR technique in PNF stretching on the shoulder, 2) MWM on the shoulder, 3) general physical therapy and intervention with neither MWM or HR stretching. Pre- and post-intervention, each subject was randomly evaluated for shoulder flexion range of motion (ROM), shoulder flexor muscle strength, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the Korean version of the Shoulder Pain And Disability Index (SPADI).
Results: The MWM combined with HR technique group had significant effects on shoulder flexion ROM, shoulder flexor muscle strength, VAS and SPADI compared to the MWM and control group (p<0.05). The MWM group showed a significantly greater increase in shoulder flexion ROM compared to the control group (p<0.05).
Conclusions: These findings suggest that combining both the MWM and HR technique on the shoulder may more effectively improve shoulder function than MWM alone or without MWM&HR technique. Therefore, combining both the MWM and HR technique is a suggested intervention for increasing function due to shoulder adhesive capsulitis after surgery."
393,Tryptophanyl-tRNA Synthetase Sensitizes Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer to Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy,Kyung-Min Lee,2020,한국유방암학회,"Purpose: A relatively low response to chemotherapy has been reported for hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of tryptophanyl-transfer RNA synthetase (WARS) in the chemotherapeutic response of HR-positive breast cancer.
Methods: Pre-chemotherapeutic needle biopsy samples of 45 HR-positive breast cancer patients undergoing the same chemotherapeutic regimen were subjected to immunohistochemistry. To investigate the biological functions of WARS in HR-positive breast cancer, we conducted cell viability assay, flow cytometry analysis, caspase activity assay, Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting using WARS gene-modulated HR-positive breast cancer cells (T47D, ZR-75-1, and MCF7).
Results: WARS overexpression in HR-positive breast cancer patients showed a significant correlation with favorable chemotherapy response. Downregulation of WARS increased cell viability following docetaxel treatment in tumor cell lines. On the other hand, WARS overexpression sensitized the therapeutic response to docetaxel. Additionally, downregulation of WARS caused a decrease in the number of apoptotic cell populations by docetaxel. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase 3/7 activity were increased in docetaxel-treated tumor cells with WARS overexpression.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that WARS might be a potential predictor for chemotherapy response in patients with HR-positive breast cancer as well as a novel molecular target to improve chemosensitivity."
394,The Ascidian Numb Gene Involves in the Formation of Neural Tissues,Hong Ryul Ahn,2012,한국발생생물학회,"Notch signaling plays fundamental roles in various animal development. It has been suggested that Hr-Notch,a Notch homologue in the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi, is involved in the formation of peripheral neurons by suppressing the neural fates and promoting the epidermal differentiation. However, roles of Notch signaling remain controversial in the formation of nervous system in ascidian embryos. To precisely investigate functions of Notch signaling, we have isolated and characterized Hr-Numb, a Numb homologue which is a negative regulator of Notch signaling, in H. roretzi. Maternal expression of Hr-Numb mRNAs was detected in egg cytoplasm and the transcripts were inherited by the animal blastomeres.
Its zygotic expression became evident by the early neurula stage and the transcripts were detected in dorsal neural precursor cells. Suppression of Hr-Numb function by an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide resulted in larvae with defect in brain vesicle and palps formation. Similar results have been obtained by overexpression of the constitutively activated Hr-Notch forms. Therefore, these results suggest that Hr-Numb is involved in Notch signaling during ascidian embryogenesis."
395,Coverage percentage and coverage rate of different DNA nanostructures grown on a mica substrate,Saima Bashar,2015,한국물리학회,"In this study, we simultaneously grew different DNA nanostructures, including 5 helix ribbon (5HR), double-crossover (DX), and double-crossover with single hairpin (DX-SH) lattices, on a mica substrate, and we analyzed the concentration-dependent coverage percentages of 5HR at a fixed concentration of DX ([DX]), DX at a fixed [5HR], and DX-SH with both fixed [5HR] and [DX]. The structural features of the various nanostructures formed through mica-assisted growth annealing were confirmed via atomic force microscopy. To assess the temperature-dependent coverage rates on the given substrates, we introduced two simple models, i.e., the equipartition model (EPM) and the un-equipartition model (UEPM) which provide information on the amount of coverage for each of the given temperature. EPM provides an equal amount of the coverage percentage per temperature change due to its linear nature, but UEPM does not since it has a non-linear nature. The coverage percentages obtained by these models allow us to calculate, as a function of temperature, the coverage rates of 5HR at a fixed [DX] and DX-SH for both fixed [5HR] and [DX]. Although with EPM the coverage rates for the 5HR and DX-SH decreased linearly as the temperature decreased, they decreased non-linearly as the temperature decreased with UEPM."
396,Comparison of characteristics during backward walking according to various stride frequencies in underwater and ground environments,김희중 /Heejoong Kim,2018,물리치료재활과학회,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between heart rate (HR), self-awareness of exercise intensity (rating of perceived exertion, RPE), and 5-meter walk test (5MWT) of persons affected by stroke during backward walking according to the preferred stride frequency (PSF), PSF＋3 and PSF＋6 conditions.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Methods: A total of 11 persons with stroke (9 males, 2 females) participated voluntarily. All patients underwent backward walking under the PSF, PSF＋3, and PSF＋6 conditions in underwater and ground environments, and each condition was performed for 5 minutes. The HR, RPE, and walking speeds were measured during walking, and the measured values from underwater and ground environments were compared.
Results: The HR and RPE in the ground environment were significantly increased (p<0.05), and although the 5MWT showed an increase in speed, it was not significant. The HR and RPE in the underwater environment were also significantly increased (p<0.05), however, although the 5MWT results was increased, it was not significant. The HR and RPE were significantly increased in the PSF＋6 condition (p<0.05).
Conclusions: The results of this study showed that backward gait training underwater can provide an appropriate exercise intensity for stroke survivors and suggests that exercises performed in an underwater environment is more effective compared to the ground environment."

특히, 핵심인재 확보 및 유지관리제도는 그동안 시장형 HR 시스템 하에 조직의 경쟁우위를 가져올 수 있는 HR 프랙티스로 여겨져 왔으나 본 연구는 이와는 다른 각도에서 핵심인재의 새로운 지식과 스킬의 확산 뿐 아니라 회사 고유의 지식의 축적의 효익은 핵심인재 채용 및 유지/관리의 비용을 뛰어 넘지 못했으며 더 나아가 조직의 비효율성을 가져올 수 있어 조직에 역기능을 초래할 수 있다는 가능성을 제시하였다. 특히, 집합주의에 기반한 국내 조직에서는 위 제도가 더욱 심각한 문제를 나타낼 수 있음을 암시하면서 2000년대 중반 이후 핵심인재 채용과 유지관리를 가장 중요한 HR 경영의 화두로 삼고 있는 국내 기업들에게 새로운 시사점을 제공했다고 할 수 있다.
결론적으로, 본 연구는 역동적인 현대의 시장 환경에서 핵심인재관리제도의 시행이 조직 효율성에 미치는 부정적 영향에 대한 실증적 근거를 제한적으로 발견하였다. 따라서 후속연구에서는 이러한 역기능의 발생 가능성에도 불구, 여전히 필요성이 대두되고 있는 핵심인재 관리제도의 시행이, 조직에 미칠 수 있는 부정적인 영향을 최소화하고 본연의 성과를 달성하기 위한 조직 내의 구체적인 방안 등에 대해 고민해야 할 것이다.This study examines the effect of the top talent management HR practice on firm efficiency. Using a longitudinal survey conducted by the government sponsored research institution over 358 Korean firms, the results show that war for top talent management practice does not have a significant impact on firm efficiency measured by labor productivity and return on assets(ROA). However, findings partially support that there is a negative relationship between the top talent management practices and firm-level relative efficiency such that a broad use of top talent management practices may increase firm-level inefficiency using the Stochastic Frontier Production Function (SFPF).Top Talent Management Practice, Firm efficiency, Stochastic Frontier Production Function"

HR analytics is an important area for applying big data analysis techniques to human resources. It provides organizational insight that enables effective management of employees, allowing management to reach their business goals quickly and efficiently. Job satisfaction and employee turnover analysis are the keys to HR analytics. Job review web services have been becoming popular. Because people exchange information about job satisfaction and turnover through these web services, useful information about HR Analytics is accumulated on the job review web sites.
In this paper, we identified factors of employee retention by analyzing a Job Satisfaction/Retention group, and the factors of employee turnover by analyzing a Job Unsatisfaction/Turnover group. In order to do this, we first classified employees according to whether their self-reported job satisfaction or turnover was true. We collected and analyzed data from Jobplanet, a popular job review site. Through dominance analysis and LDA topic modeling, we found major factors, topics, and keywords of the classified groups by IT, service, and manufacturing domains. Our approach is a novel model to apply the analysis of reviews and text mining to the HR domain, and it will be practically helpful for setting new strategies that improve job satisfaction."

Methods: Patients who were newly diagnosed with a solitary hepatocellular carcinoma were randomized to the HR or RFA group. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age ≥ 20 years but ≤ 70 years, Child-Pugh class A, maximal diameter of the tumor ≥ 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm, no previous treatment history, and platelet count > 80,000/mm3.
Results: Although the study was early terminated, 29 and 34 patients were enrolled in the HR and RFA groups, respectively, and prospectively followed on an intention-to-treat basis. The 5-year overall survival rates were 83.4% and 86.2% in the HR and RFA groups, respectively, which were not significantly different (P = 0.812 by log-rank, P = 0.990 by Breslow). The 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates in the HR group were significantly superior to those in the RFA group (66.7%, 44.4% vs. 44.1%, 31.2%, P = 0.071 by log-rank, P = 0.023 by Breslow). Intrahepatic local recurrence tended to develop more frequently in the RFA group (P = 0.042), while the frequency of intrahepatic distant and extrahepatic recurrence was similar bet ween the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in the frequency and severity of complications between the 2 groups.
Conclusion: HR was significantly superior to RFA in terms of disease-free survival; however, the overall survival was excellent in both groups."

Our study confirmed that the pH of the 24-hr germinated soybeans was 6.7, and the value increased as fermentation progressed. The amount of viscous substances in the cheonggukjang produced with the 24-hr germinated soybeans constantly increased to 5.89% at 36 hr of fermentation, and then remained unchanged.
Free sugars (raffinose, sucrose, glucose, and fructose) rapidly decreased with the fermentation process. The levels of free amino acids in the 24-hr germinated agakong and the 48-hr fermented cheonggukjang were 391.0 and 10,994.8 mg%, respectively. Glutamic acid content was highest, followed by aspartic acid, lysine, leucine, and proline. The ratio of glutamic acid to total free amino acids at 48-hr of fermentation was 18.0%. Finally, it was confirmed that the sensory evaluation score of the 24-36 hr fermented cheonggukjang, made with the 24-hr germinated soybeans, was superior to that of the 24 and 48-hr fermented cheonggukjang."
403,국소관련간질 환자의 발작 전후 심박수 변화,정은혜,2010,대한신경과학회,"Background: Epileptic seizures can be associated with changes in autonomic functions. This study evaluated heart rate (HR) changes at the transition from the preictal to the ictal state in patients with epileptic seizures, and investigated whether peri-ictal HR changes can help to predict electroencephalography (EEG) seizures prior to their onset.
Methods: We retrospectively studied 94 seizures in 33 patients who underwent video-EEG monitoring with scalp EEG and electrocardiography. The existence and initial timing of HR changes relative to the onset of EEG seizures were determined by analyzing consecutive RR-interval changes in 10-minute recordings. We evaluated the correlation between the peri-ictal HR changes and the type of localization-related epilepsy.
Results: Peri-ictal HR changes were documented in 70.2% (66/94) of all seizures, of which 62 were tachycardia (66.0%)and 4 were bradycardia (4.3%). Peri-ictal tachycardia occurred significantly with seizures as an ictal manifestation, more often in seizures with a right hemispheric onset than in those with a left hemispheric onset (77.4% vs. 50%, p=0.016).
Peri-ictal HR changes were observed much earlier in seizures of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) than in those of extratemporal lobe epilepsy (–54.4 s vs. –6.7 s, p<0.001).
Conclusions: Peri-ictal HR changes were observed in 70.2% of seizures, 94% of which were tachycardia. These changes could be helpful in predicting seizure onset, especially in mesial TLE."
404,Spot Urine Albumin to Creatinine Ratio and Serum Cystatin C are Effective for Detection of Diabetic Nephropathy in Childhood Diabetic Patients,채현욱 /hyun wook Chae,2012,대한의학회,"Spot urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) measurement has been suggested as a surrogate to 24-hr urine collection for the assessment of microalbuminuria, and cystatin C (cysC) is known as an advantageous marker for renal function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical values of spot urinary ACR and serum cysC for the assessment of diabetic nephropathy instead of 24-hr urine microalbumin in children and adolescents with diabetes. A total of 113 children and adolescents (age 12-19 yr, M:F = 47:66) with type 1 or 2 diabetes were enrolled. We evaluated the validity of spot urine ACR and serum cysC,and then compared them to 24-hr urine microalbumin and creatinine clearance. Spot urine ACR was correlated with 24-hr urine albumin excretion (R2 = 0.828, P = 0.001) and creatinine clearance (R2 = 0.249, P = 0.017). The ROC curve analysis of serum cysC demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy than that of serum creatinine (AUC 0.732 vs 0.615). Both the measurements of spot urine ACR and serum cysC might better predict the presence of diabetic nephropathy than 24-hr urine microalbumin in childhood diabetic patients."
405,High-Resolution Contrast-Enhanced 3D-Spoiled Gradient-Recalled Imaging for Evaluation of Intracranial Vertebral Artery and Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery in Lateral Medullary Infarction,윤영노,2014,대한자기공명의과학회,"Purpose : To determine whether high-resolution contrast-enhanced three dimensional imaging with spoiled gradientrecalled sequence (HR-CE 3D-SPGR) plays a meaningful role in the assessment of intracranial vertebral artery (ICVA) and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in lateral medullary infarction (LMI).
Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients confirmed with LMI were retrospectively enrolled with approval by the IRB of our institute, and 3T MRI with HR-CE 3D-SPGR and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) were performed. Two radiologists who were blinded to clinical information and other brain MR images including diffusion weighted image independently evaluated arterial lesions in ICVA and PICA. The demographic characteristics, the area of LMI and cerebellar involvement were analyzed and compared between patients with arterial lesion in ICVA only and patients with arterial lesions in both ICVA and PICA on HR-CE 3D-SPGR.
Results: Twenty-two of twenty-five LMI patients had arterial lesions in ICVA or PICA on HR-CE 3D SPGR. However twelve arterial lesions in PICA were not shown on CE-MRA. Concurrent cerebellar involvement appeared more in LMI patients with arterial lesion in ICVA and PICA than those with arterial lesion in ICVA alone (p = 0.069).
Conclusion: HR-CE 3D-SPGR can help evaluate arterial lesions in ICVA and PICA for LMI patients.목적: 측면연수경색 환자의 두개내 척추동맥 및 뒤아래소뇌동맥 평가에 있어 고해상도 조영증강 삼차원 회손기울기에코 회상영상의 역할 규명하고자 한다.

406,"수온차이가 반복적인 무호흡잠수 중 심박수, 젖산, 그리고 혈중산소포화도 반응에 미치는 영향",김병조,2012,한국생활환경학회,"This study examined whether repeated breath-hold diving (BHD) in cold water would impact on heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration (Lac), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) responses. Seven young healthy collegiate men (20.4 ± 0.5 yrs, 176.4 ± 5.2 cm, 68.6 ± 5.1 kg, 22.0 ± 1.3 kg·m-2) who were open water diver certified participated in two testing sessions; a cold water diving (CW; 17 ± 1oC) and a moderate water diving (MW; 27 ± 1oC). They were not acclimated to cold prior to study and familiarized with BHD. In both sessions, they repeated a 30-sec long, 5-meter deep BHD for 20 times, and rested 30 sec between each trial, except 1 min resting at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th trials when measurements were taken. Baseline data for HR, Lac, and SpO2 outside of the pool were obtained at rest.
During BHD, HR was measured at both bottom and surface using electronic HR monitor by a skilled scuba diver.
HR, Lac using a finger prick method, and SpO2 using pulse oximetry were measured after 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th trials. All completed BHD sessions in both water temperature. During BHD, HR increased as the diving was repeated and the final HR was 129.7 ± 17.3 for MW and 134.1 ± 15.1 beat·min-1 for CW. No water temperature effects were found in HR. Lac changed from 1.4 ± 0.3 at rest to 4.5 ± 1.5 at the final in MW and from 1.4 ± 0.2 at rest to 5.4 ± 1.2mmol/L at the final in CW, and the water temperature effect was noticed (p < 0.05). As BHD progressed, SpO2decreased gradually from 98.4 ± 0.5 at rest to 71.3 ± 4.3% after 20th trial in MW and from 98.6 ± 0.5 at rest to 65.6 ± 3.5% at the end of CW, and a significant interaction was noticed (p < 0.05). Data indicated that a repeated BHD at cold water resulted in an increased blood lactate and decreased blood oxygen saturation compared to relatively comfortable water temperature in an unhabituated human. No cardiac alterations were obvious during BHD in cold water."
407,"Growth Dynamics of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a Function of Time to Detection in BacT/Alert 3D Blood Culture Bottles with Various Preincubation Conditions",이동현 /Lee Dong-Hyun,2013,대한진단검사의학회,"Background: Delayed entry of blood culture bottles is inevitable when microbiological laboratories do not operate for 24 hr. There are few studies reported for prestorage of these bottles. The growth dynamics of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated with respect to various preincubation conditions.
Methods: Fifteen or 150 colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria were inoculated into standard aerobic or anaerobic blood culture bottles. Bottles were preincubated at 25°C or 37°C for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, or 48 hr. The time to detection (TTD) then was monitored using the BacT/Alert 3D system (bioMerieux Inc., USA).
Results: Significant difference in TTD was observed following preincubation for 8 hr at 25°C vs. 4 hr at 37°C for S. aureus, 4 hr at 25°C vs. 4 hr at 37°C for E. coli, 12 hr at 25°C vs. 4 hr at 37°C for P. aeruginosa, compared to no preincubation (P<0.005). TTD values did not vary significantly with bacterial CFU or with aerobic or anaerobic bottle type. The BacT/Alert 3D system returned false negatives following preincubation of P. aeruginosa for 48 hr at 25°C or 24 hr at 37°C.
Conclusions: TTD was mainly affected by preincubation temperature and duration rather than by input CFU quantity or bottle type for the 3 experimental bacteria."
408,Bioethanol Production from Hydrodictyon reticulatum by Fed-Batch Fermentation Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae KCTC7017,김슬기 /KIM SEUL KI,2017,한국미생물·생명공학회,"The aim of this study was to develop a potential process for bioethanol production from Hydrodictyon reticulatum (HR), a filamentous freshwater alga, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (KCTC7017). From the sugar solutions prepared by the four different hydrolysis methods, bioethanol production ranged from 11.0 g/100 g dried material (acid hydrolysis) to 22.3 g/ 100 g dried material (enzymatic hydrolysis, EH). Bioethanol was fermented from a highly concentrated sugar solution obtained by a decompression-mediated (vacuum) enrichment method (VE). As the results, ethanol was more efficiently produced from HR when sugar solutions were concentrated by VE following EH (EH/VE). Using multiple feeding of the sugar solution prepared by EH/VE from HR, ethanol reached up to a concentration of 54.3 g/l, corresponding to 24.9 g/100 g dried material, which attained the economic level of product concentration (approximately 5%). The results indicate that by using HR, it is feasible to establish a bioethanol production process, which is effective for using microalgae as the raw material for ethanol production."
409,Comparative study on bone regeneration between silk mat incorporated 4-hexylresorcinol and collagen membrane,석현 /Hyun Seok,2017,한국잠사학회,"The purpose of this study was (1) to demonstrate the anti-microbial properties of 4-hexylresorcinol (4HR) loaded silk mat and (2) comparison of bone formation between 4HR incorporated silk mat and collagen membrane. Anti-microbial properties of 4HR incorporated silk mat was done after sterilization of silk mat (autoclaving and ethylene oxide gas). For the evaluation of bone formation, bilateral bony defects (size: 8 mm) were prepared in the parietal bone of the rabbits (n=10). 4HR incorporated silk mat (size: 10 x 10 mm) was applied on the right defect. For the comparative purpose, the same size of commercial collagen membrane was applied on the left defect. The anti-microbial properties of 4HR incorporated silk mat were maintained after sterilization process. When compared bone mineral density and bone volume, there was no statistically significant difference between groups at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after operation (p>0.05). In conclusion, 4HR incorporated silk mat could be autoclaved without concern of anti-microbial properties loss. In addition, 4HR incorporated silk mat showed similar bone regeneration to collagen membrane. Therefore, 4HR incorporated silk mat might be considered for the application of open membrane technique."
410,The Factors Associated With Health-Related Quality of Life in Stroke Survivors Age 40 and Older,전나은 /Naeun Jeon,2017,대한재활의학회,"Objective To evaluate the association between clinical and socio-demographic status and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in stroke survivors age 40 and older in the Korean population.Methods The relationship between stroke and HR-QoL was investigated using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), conducted from 2007–2012. The total number of respondents was 24,050 and 757 stroke survivors were included. Specifically, we investigated factors associated with the lowering of HR-QoL in a group of Korean adult stroke patients age 40 and older after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, anthropometric measurements, and clinical comorbidities. Adjusted effects of covariates on EuroQol-visual analog scales (EQ-VAS) scores were estimated with a complex-samples general linear model and multivariate-adjusted odds ratios of the lowest quintile versus highest quintile of the EQ-VAS scores in the stroke group were estimated with a complex-samples logistic regression model.Results Socio-demographic, anthropometric factors, and clinical comorbidities significantly differed between the stroke and non-stroke groups, except regarding gender and residential area. The EQ-VAS was significantly lower in the stroke than non-stroke group. Anxiety/depression problems significantly lowered EQ-VAS, as did low education level, smoking, mobility and usual activities problems. Also, aging in 1-year increments and cardiovascular disease had a significant effect on lower EQ-VAS in stroke survivors. Conclusion People with a stroke have significantly lower HR-QoL than healthy subjects. Therefore, managing depression, smoking, or cardiovascular disease and maintenance of physical function may be priority goals in improving HR-QoL after a stroke."
411,The correlation of heart rate between natural sleep and dexmedetomidine sedation,강동희 /Kang Dong Hee,2019,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: Sedation by dexmedetomidine, like natural sleep, often causes bradycardia. We explored the nature of heart rate (HR) changes as they occur during natural sleep versus those occurring during dexmedetomidine sedation.
Methods: The present study included 30 patients who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery with spinal anesthesia.
To assess HR and sedation, a pulse oximeter and bispectral index (BIS) monitor were attached to the patient in the ward and the operating room. After measuring HR and BIS at baseline, as the patients slept and once their BIS was below 70, HR and BIS were measured at 5-minute intervals during sleep. Baseline HR and BIS were also recorded before spinal anesthesia measured at 5-minute intervals after dexmedetomidine injection.
Results: During natural sleep, HR changes ranged from 2 to 19 beats/min (13.4 ± 4.4 beats/min), while in dexmedetomidine sedation, HR ranged from 9 to 40 beats/min (25.4 ± 8.5 beats/min). Decrease in HR was significantly correlated between natural sleep and dexmedetomidine sedation (R2 = 0.41, P < 0.001). The lowest HR was reached in 66 min during natural sleep (59 beats/min) and in 13 min with dexmedetomidine sedation (55 beats/min). The time to reach minimum HR was significantly different (P < 0.001), but there was no difference in the lowest HR obtained (P = 0.09).
Conclusions: There was a correlation between the change in HR during natural sleep and dexmedetomidine sedation.
The bradycardia that occurs when using dexmedetomidine may be a normal physiologic change, that can be monitored rather than corrected."
412,Development of objective indicators for quantitative analysis of sodium intake: the sodium to potassium ratio of second-void urine is correlated with 24-hour urinary sodium excretion,Jung Gon Kim,2020,한국영양학회,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To date, sodium intake has been evaluated based on spot urine instead of 24-hour (hr) urine collection.
Nevertheless, the optimal method for assessing daily sodium intake remains unclear.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fifteen male (age 32.7 ± 6.5 years) participants were offered 3 meals with a total of 9-10 g salt over 24 hours, and 24-hr urine was collected from the second-void urine of the first day to the first-void urine of the second day. Twenty-four-hr urinary sodium (24UNa) was estimated using Tanaka’s equation and the Korean formula, and spot urine Na, potassium (K), chloride (Cl), urea nitrogen (UN), creatinine (Cr), specific gravity (SG) and osmolality (Osm) were measured.
The ratios of urinary Na to other parameters were calculated, and correlations with total measured 24UNa were identified.
RESULTS: Average 24-hr urine volume was 1,403 ± 475 mL, and measured 24UNa was 143.9 ± 42.1 mEq (range, 87.1-239.4 mEq).
Measured 24UNa was significantly correlated with urinary Na/UN (r = 0.560, P < 0.01), urinary Na/Osm (r = 0.510, P < 0.01), urinary Na/Cr (r = 0.392, P < 0.01), urinary Na/K (r = 0.290, P < 0.01), 24UNa estimated using Tanaka’s equation (r = 0.452, P < 0.01) and the Korean formula (r = 0.414, P < 0.01), age (r = 0.548, P < 0.01), weight (r = 0.497, P < 0.01), and height (r = 0.393, P < 0.01) in all spot urine samples. Estimated 24UNa based on the second-void spot urine of the first day tended to be more closely correlated with measured 24UNa than were estimates from the other spot urine samples. The significant parameters correlated with the second-void urine of the first day were urinary Na/K (r = 0.647, P < 0.01), urinary Na/Cr (r = 0.558, P < 0.05), and estimated 24UNa using Tanaka’s equation (r = 0.616, P < 0.05) and the Korean formula (r = 0.588, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Second-void urine is more reliable than first-void urine for estimating 24UNa. Urinary Na/K in the second-void urine on the first day is significantly correlated with 24UNa. Further studies are needed to establish the most reliable index and the optimal time of urine sampling for predicting 24UNa."
413,"자두(홍로센, 헐리웃) 과피 열수추출물의 항산화능과 피부미백 효능 비교",유용기,2013,한국미용학회,"This study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidative ability and whitening efficacy of peel's water extracts from hongrosen (HR)and hollywood (HW) using in vitro tests or melan-a cells. In the antioxidative ability, the total polyphenol contents of HR and HW were 3.2 and 3.9 mg/g, respectively. The total flavonoid contents of HR and HW were 1.1 and 1.8 mg/g, respectively. The electron donating abilities of HR and HW at 1,000 μg/mL concentration were 12.2 and 13.2%, respectively. The ABTS radical scavenging activities of HR and HW at 1,000 μg/mL concentration were 45.0 and 60.2%, respectively. The SOD-like activities of HR and HW at 1,000 μg/mL concentration were 31.0 and 46.3%, respectively. In the whitening efficacy tests using melan-a cells, the maximum permissible level for HR and HW was ascertained over 200 μg/mL. For the melanin synthetic abilities at 50 μg/mL concentration, the arbutin, HR and HW significantly (p<0.05) reduced by 23.4, 16.4 and 28.5%, respectively, than the control. For the intra-cellular tyrosinase activities at 50 μg/mL concentration, the arbutin, HR and HW significantly (p<0.05) reduced by 17.2, 10.9 and 9.0%,respectively, than the control. For the cell-extracted tyrosinase activities at 50 μg/mL concentration, the arbutin, HR and HW significantly (p<0.05) reduced by 47.5, 31.9 and 47.5%, respectively, than the control. Taken the results in together, peel's water extracts from hongrosen and hollywood effectively inhibited melanin synthesis via inhibiting tyrosinase activity. The peel of hollywood had higher whitening efficacy than those of hongrosen and arbutin. Therefore, peel of hollywood can be used as the functional natural material for the whitening cosmetics."
414,The effect of 4-hexylresorcinol on xenograft degradation in a rat calvarial defect model,Yei-Jin Kang,2016,대한악안면성형재건외과학회,"Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate xenograft degradation velocity when treated with 4-hexylresorcinol (4HR).
Methods: The scapula of a cow was purchased from a local grocery, and discs (diameter 8 mm, thickness 1 mm) were prepared by trephine bur. Discs treated with 4HR were used as the experimental group. Untreated discs were used as the control. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), antibacterial test, endotoxin test, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed on the discs. In vivo degradation was evaluated by the rat calvarial defect model.
Results: The XRD and FT-IR results demonstrated successful incorporation of 4HR into the bovine bone.
The experimental disc showed antibacterial properties. The endotoxin test yielded results below the level of endotoxin contamination. In the SEM exam, the surface of the experimental group showed needle-shaped crystal and spreading of RAW264.7 cells. In the animal experiments, the amount of residual graft was significantly smaller in the experimental group compared to the control group (P = 0.003).
Conclusions: In this study, 4HR was successfully incorporated into bovine bone, and 4HR-incorporated bovine bone had antibacterial properties. In vivo experiments demonstrated that 4HR-incorporated bovine bone showed more rapid degradation than untreated bovine bone."
415,Characteristics of Aerobic Exercise as Determinants of Blood Pressure Control in Hypertensive Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,이선희 /Lee， Sun-Hee,2020,한국간호과학회,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) according to aerobic exercise characteristics in adults with hypertension using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: The related researches were selected from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus and 5 domestic databases up to September 4, 2019. To estimate the effect size, random effect models were used to derive weighted mean differences (WMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) of aerobic exercise on BP and HR. Results: A total of 37 RCTs with 1,813 samples were included. Aerobic exercise was found to significantly reduce systolic BP (WMD, - 8.29 mmHg; 95% CI, - 10.12 to - 6.46), diastolic BP (WMD, - 5.19 mmHg; 95% CI, - 6.24 to - 4.14) and HR (WMD, - 4.22 beats/min; 95% CI, - 5.36 to –3.09). In detail, systolic BP and diastolic BP were significantly decreased in all groups of exercise types, frequency and duration. Systolic BP and diastolic BP were significantly decreased in the moderate and vigorous-intensity group. Exercise characteristics with the most dramatical change in systolic BP were water-based training, moderate-intensity, 3 times a week and 8 to 11 weeks of duration. In diastolic BP, the greatest effect size was over 24 weeks of exercise. Conclusion: Moderate aerobic exercise, especially water-based exercise can be an important part of lifestyle modification for hypertensive patients. Also, it can be recommended in a variety of clinical settings for lowering BP and HR. However, there is insufficient evidence that low-intensity exercise is effective in lowering BP."
416,A Simple Method for Isolation of Polymannuronate and Polyguluronate from Alginate Hydrolyzed by Organic Acids,이동수,2009,한국생명과학회,"Alginate with a MW of 1,283 kDa was hydrolyzed with 0.4 M organic acids at 100oC for 3 hr. Molecular weights of alginates hydrolyzed with organic acids ranged from 7.5 to 53.2 kDa. There was no significant difference in the molar ratio of mannuronate to guluronate in alginates hydrolyzed with organic acids. Acetic acid was found to be the most effective organic acid for hydrolysis of alginate. The MW of alginate decreased with increasing concentration and reaction time with acetic acid as a hydrolyzing agent. The correlations between the MW of hydrolyzed alginate and concentration of acetic acid as well as reaction time with 0.4 M acetic acid were plotted and the relevant equations obtained in this study. Polymannuronate and polyguluronate were isolated by pH adjustment of alginate hydrolyzed with 0.4 M acetic acid. The molar percentages of mannuronate in polymannuronates isolated from alginate hydrolyzed with 0.4 M acetic acid at 100oC were increasing in proportional to the reaction time such as 75% for 1 hr, 90% for 3 hr, and 98% for 5 hr of reaction time.분자량이 1,283 kDa인 알긴산을 0.4 M 유기산을 사용하여 100oC에서 3시간 반응시켜 가수분해하였다. 유기산에 의하여 가수분해된 알긴산의 분자량은 7.5에서 53.2 kDa이었다. 유기산으로 가수분해된 알긴산을 구성하는 만뉴론산과 글루론산의 비율은 가수분해하지 않은 알긴산과 비교하여 큰 차이가 없었다. 사용한 유기산 중에서 알긴산을 가수분해하는 가장 효과적인 유기산은 초산이었다. 사용한 초산의 농도 및 반응시간이 증가할수록 가수분해된 알긴산의 분자량은 감소하였다. 본 연구를 통하여 가수분해된 알긴산의 분자량과 초산의 농도 및 반응시간과의 상관관계를 나타내는 관계식을 구하였다. 초산으로 가수분해한 알긴산의 pH를 조절하여 폴리만뉴론산과 폴리글루론산을 분리하였다. 초산과 반응하는 시간이 증가할수록 폴리만뉴론산에 존재하는 만뉴론산의 비율은 증가하였다. 폴리만뉴론산에 존재하는 만뉴론산의 비율은 100oC에서 0.4 M 초산과 1시간, 3시간 및 5시간 반응하였을 경우에 각각 75%, 90% 및 98%이었다."
417,A comparison between surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma,박은규,2014,대한외과학회,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and hepatic resection (HR) with regards to procedural morbidity, mortality, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.
Methods: Retrospective studies were performed based on the medical records of 129 patients who underwent curative HR, and 57 who patients received RFA for HCC, between 2005 and 2009. The inclusion criteria of HCC were the presence of three or fewer nodules 3 cm or less in diameter or a single nodule of 5 cm or less.
Results: The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates in the HR group were 91.3%, 78.8%, and 64.9%, compared to 94.4%, 74.0%, and 74.0% in the RFA group, with no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.725). The estimated 1- and 3-year DFS rates were 70.0% and 53.0% in the HR group and 65.2% and 24.7% in the RFA group, respectively. The DFS rates of HR group were significantly higher than RFA group (P = 0.015). Multivariate analysis identified that recurrence (P = 0.036) and portal hypertension (P = 0.036) were associated with OS and that portal hypertension (P = 0.048) and increased serum a-FP (P = 0.008) were the factors significantly associated with DFS.
Conclusion: HCC within Milan criteria should consider hepatectomy as the primary treatment if the patient's liver function and general conditions are good enough to undergo surgical operation. But in that RFA revealed similar overall survival to HR, RFA can be an alternative therapy for patients who are eligible for surgical resection"

Total free sugars were higher in HR compared with FR. Sucrose, fructose, and glucose were the major free sugars in both HR and FR. Contents of essential and non-essential amino acids were higher in HR compared with FR. The major organic acid of FR was malic acid, and the major organic acid of HR was malic acid. The contents of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were higher in HR than in FR. Total mineral contents were higher in FR (10,187.22 mg%) compared with HR (9,815.80 mg%). Major minerals were K, Ca, and Na in the two drying methods. The contents of vitamins C and E in HR were higher than those in FR. Total polyphenol contents showed no significant difference between the two methods. However, total flavonoid contents in HR were higher than in FR. The IC50 values of FR and HR in ABTS assay were 0.89 mg/mL and 0.65 mg/mL, respectively. The results of all experiments suggest that HR and FR can be natural candidates as a rich source of antioxidants for further chemical investigation."

The subjects were twenty-eight healthy men in their twenties. All ofthemperformed upper and lower extremity isokinetic ergometer exercise tests which had six loads (400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 kg-m/min) and five loads (400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 kg-m/min) respectively. The exercise sessions were finished whenHRwasin plateau. HR and oxygen consumption were determined during the final minute. Resting heart rate and oxygen consumption were used for calculating heart rate, oxygen consumption changes and modified PCI. Regression analysis established therelationshipbetween each variable to work load, HR and oxygen consumption. The results were as follows: 1) In the lower extremity ergometer exercise test, oxygen consumption increased continuously as work load increased, but in the upper extremity ergometertest,oxygen consumption only increased until work load was 700 kg-m/min. 2) HR increased as work load increased in both exercise tests, but in the upper extremity ergometer test, HR decrease from the 700 kg-m/min. 3) The modified PCI increased asworkloadincreased until the 700 kg-m/min point in the lower extremity ergometer test and until the 500 kg-m/min point in the upper extremity ergometer test when it started to decrease in both tests. 4) In the lower extremity ergometer exercise test,regressionanalysis established the relation as dVO2 = -.0215HR - .2141 where dVO2 is given in 1/min and HR in beat/min (R2 = .2677, p= .000). In the upper extremity ergometer exercise test, regression analysis establishedtherelation as dVO2 = -.0115HR + .2746 (R2 = .1308, p= .000). The results of this study were similar to previous studies but were different under high work load conditions. So modified PCI should be used with only low intensityworkload testing. Subjects for upper extremity ergometer exercise testing should complete a prescribed training course prior to testing, and only low intensity work load should be used for sftety conseiderations."
421,Root Gravitropic Response of Phytochrome Mutant (phyAB) in Arabidopsis,우순화,2008,한국생명과학회,"Phytochrome double mutant (phyAB) showed the delayed root gravitropic response compared to the wild type (WT) in Arabidopsis. After 8 hr of gravistimulation, the gravitropic response of mutant showed 48% of the WT. The delayed response started at 1.5 hr after gravistimulation. And we measured the ethylene production in the root segments of WT and mutant for 12 hr. Ethylene production of mutant decreased about 40% of the WT at 12 hr. This result suggested that the phytochrome might be linked with ethylene production in some way. Generally, ethylene inhibits the growth of plant organs including roots. We measured the root growth rate in the presence of ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid), a precursor of ethylene. And WT showed the inhibition of root growth with ACC, but mutant did not show the inhibition as WT did. To confirm the relationship between the ethylene and gravitropic response, we measured the gravitropic response with ACC. In the presence of 10-6 M ACC, WT showed the 37.4% inhibition compared to the control (no ACC), whereas mutant showed the only 6.6% inhibition of control (no ACC). This research suggested the relationship between phytochrome and gravitropic response through an ethylene production.Arabidopsis의 피토크롬 2중 돌연변이형 (phyAB)은 야생형 (WT)과 비교하여 뿌리의 굴중성 반응이 지연되었다. 중력 자극을 받은 지 8시간 후에 돌연변이체의 굴중성 반응은 야생형의 48%를 나타내었다. 지연된 반응은 중력 자극을 준 후 1.5 시간 뒤에 나타났다. 12시간 동안 야생형과 돌연변이형의 뿌리 절편에서 에틸렌 생성을 측정하였다. 돌연변이형의 에틸렌 생성은 12시간이 경과한 후에 야생형의 40% 정도로 감소되었다. 이러한 결과는 피토크롬이 에틸렌 생성과 연관되어 있음을 제시하고 있다. 일반적으로 에틸렌은 식물의 뿌리나 줄기를 억제한다. 본 연구에서는 에틸렌 전구체인 1-aminocycloprpane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)를 처리하여 뿌리의 생장을 측정하였다. 야생형은 ACC 존재하에 뿌리 생장이 억제되었으나, 돌연변이형은 야생형만큼 억제를 나타내지 않았다. 이 결과를 확인하기 위하여 ACC 존재 하에 굴중성 반응을 측정한 결과, 야생형은 ACC가 없는 경우와 비교하여 37.4%의 억제를 나타냈으나, 돌연변이형은 ACC가 없는 경우와 비교하여 6.6%만을 억제하였다. 이 결과는 피토크롬이 에틸렌 생성을 통하여 뿌리 굴중성 반응을 조절한다는 것을 제시한다."

 Methods: Eighty patients scheduled for gynecologic laparoscopic surgery were randomly allocated to four groups: group C (control group, n = 20); group E (esmolol group, n = 20) received esmolol 1 mg/kg, followed by 5μg/kg/min; group EN (esmolol ＋ nicardipine group, n = 20) received esmolol 1 mg/kg and nicardipine 15μg/kg, followed by an esmolol infusion 5μg/kg/min; and group R (remifentanil group, n = 20) received remifentanil 1μg/kg, followed by 0.05μg/kg/min. The MBP and HR were measured at preinduction, after induction, at 1, 3, 5 min after intubation, before and after insufflation of CO2 and during surgical procedures. Recovery profiles and postoperative side effects were assessed. 
 Results: The change of MBP after intubation was significantly decreased in group EN. The change of HR after intubation and during surgical procedure were significantly decreased in group E and group R. Recovery profiles were significantly faster in all study groups compared with group C. 
 Conclusions: The use of esmolol in combination with nicardipine was effective in preventing the increase of MBP after intubation, whereas esmolol or remifentanil had attenuated the acute change of HR to noxious stimuli. Also the use of esmolol, nicardipine or remifentanil as an adjuvant to sevoflurane-N2O anesthesia in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery had facilitated the recovery."
423,심부전 환자에서 안정시 심박수의 의의: 전북지역 만성 심부전 등록연구,윤경호 /Kyeong Ho Yun,2012,대한고혈압학회,"Background: Chronic heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. Raised resting heart rate (HR) is a marker of cardiovascular risk in general population, as well as in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease. We studied the association between HR and cardiovascular events in patients with Cardiac Insufficiency of Various Origin in Jeonbuk (CION-J) registry. Methods: CION-J registry was a multicenter, prospective database for chronic HF. From January 2010 to December 2010, 356 HF patients who clinically stabilized at least 2 weeks were analyzed. According to resting HR, the patients divided into the tertile (lower tertile < 70/min, n = 129; middle tertile 70–80/min, n = 114; upper tertile > 80/min, n = 113). Clinical outcomes during 6-month period were compared by resting HR. Results: Patients with upper tertile revealed higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) class than in those with lower tertile. From the lower to the upper tertile, the incidence of composite events of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction,ischemic stroke, and hospitalization for HF were increased(3.1%, 4.4%, 16.8%, respectively; p < 0.001). Patients with upper tertile had a higher predictive value for the incidence of death (hazard ratio, 5.8; p = 0.036) and hospitalization for HF (hazard ratio, 6.4; p < 0.001) than in those with middle and lower tertile. In multivariate analysis, NYHA class III/IV, resting HR > 80/min, and ejection fraction < 35% were independent predictors of adverse events. Conclusions: High resting HR (>80/min) is a prognostic factor in chronic HF. Optimal treatment to reduce HR should be emphasized to improve prognosis of HF."

Methods We selected drug-naïve PD patients who visited our hospital at least 10 times with a baseline assessment of the Seoul neuropsychological battery. BP and HR were measured at each visit, and the variability of the systolic BP/diastolic BP (DBP) and HR was derived from the parameters of serial 10 office visits. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD patients was determined according to the proposed criteria with a cut-off value of z-score ≤ -2.
Results Forty-seven patients with PD (mean follow-up duration = 22.3 months) were enrolled in the study. Compared with non-MCI PD patients, MCI PD patients revealed a significant increase in HR and/or variability in DBP.
Conclusion This exploratory study showed that baseline cognition in drug-naïve PD patients might be related to the visit-to-visit variability of DBP and/or HR."
425,Effect of Food Intake on Hemodynamic Parameters during the Tilt-Table Test in Patients with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,Mario Habek,2019,대한신경과학회,"Background and Purpose The aim of this study was to determine the effect of food intake on the heart rate (HR) in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).
Methods The following five-phase protocol was applied to 41 subjects who had a sustained HR increment of ≥30 beats/min within 10 min of standing in an initial tilt-table test: 1) 10- min supine phase, 2) 10-min 70°-tilted phase, 3) ingestion of 400 mL of Nutridrink Multi Fibre ®, 4) 45-min supine phase, and 5) 10-min 70°-tilted phase. Subjects were divided into four groups: A) difference in HR for standing vs. supine (ΔHR) before the meal of ≥30 beats/min (n=13), B) ΔHR <30 beats/min before the meal but ≥30 beats/min after the meal (n=12), and C) ΔHR <30 beats/min both before and after the meal (n=16). Group D consisted of 10 healthy subjects.
Results Before the meal, ΔHR was significantly higher in group A than in all of the other groups, and in group B than in group D (p<0.001). After the meal, ΔHR was significantly higher in groups A and B (p<0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively). When we pooled patients (according to their symptoms) from group A and B into a POTS group and from group C and D into a non-POTS group, an increase in HR of 25 beats/min before the meal had a sensitivity of 92.0% and a specificity of 80.8%. After the meal, an increase in HR of 30 beats/min had a sensitivity of 96.0% and a specificity of 96.2%.
Conclusions Food intake can significantly alter the results of the tilt-table test and so should be taken into account when diagnosing POTS."

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of efonidipine on HR and BP in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Subjects and Methods: In a multi-center, prospective, open-labeled, single-armed study, we enrolled 53 patients who had mild-to-moderate hypertension {sitting diastolic BP (SiDBP) 90-110 mmHg}. After a 2-week washout, eligible patients were treated with efonidipine (40 mg once daily for 12 weeks). The primary end point was the change in HR from baseline to week 12. The secondary endpoint included the change in trough sitting BP and 24-hour mean BP between baseline and week 12. Laboratory and clinical adverse events were monitored at each study visit (4, 8, and 12 weeks). Results: Fifty-two patients were included in the inten-tion-to-treat analysis. After 12 weeks of treatment with efonidipine, the resting HR decreased significantly from baseline to week 12 {from 81.5±5.3 to 71.8±9.9 beats/minute (difference, -9.9±9.0 beats/minute), p<0.0001}. The trough BP {sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) and SiDBP} and 24-hour mean BP also decreased significantly (SiSBP: from 144.6±8.2 to 132.9±13.5 mmHg, p<0.0001; SiDBP: from 96.9±5.4 to 88.3±8.6 mmHg, p<0.0001, 24-hour mean systolic BP: from 140.4±13.5 to 133.8±11.6 mmHg, p<0.0001; 24-hour mean diastolic BP: from 91.7±8.7 to 87.5±9.5 mmHg, p<0.0001). Con-clusion: Efonidipine was effective in controlling both HR and BP in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension."
428,The Effect of Silk Membrane Plus 3% 4-hexylresorcinol on Guided Bone Regeneration in a Rabbit Calvarial Defect Model,석 현,2013,한국잠사학회,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the bone regeneration capability of silk membrane plus 3% 4-hexylresorcinol (3% 4-HR plus SM) in a rabbit calvarial defect model. Twenty New Zealand white rabbits were used in this study. Bilateral round shaped defects were created in the parietal bone (diameter: 8.0 mm). And the defects were covered with (1) 3% 4-HR plus SM, (2) collagen membrane (CM), (3) no graft material. After surgery, the animals were sacrificed at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Bone regeneration was analyzed in each section by micro-computerized tomography (μ-CT). And Hematoxylin and eosin stains were used for histological analysis. As measured by μ-CT analysis 4 weeks after surgery, the average of new bone formation in animals treated with 3% 4-HR plus SM was greater than that of animals treated with CM. and the difference was statistically significant. And well organized lamella bones were observed in the histological view of the 3% 4-HR plus SM group. Therefore, more bone regeneration was seen in animals treated with 3% 4-HR plus SM than in those treated with CM or uncovered control."
429,Survival outcomes of hepatic resection compared with transarterial chemoembolization or sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombosis,이정민,2016,대한간학회,"Background/Aims: Treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) remains controversial. We compared the outcomes of hepatic resection (HR), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and sorafenib therapy as treatments for HCC with PVTT.
Methods: Patients diagnosed as HCC with PVTT between January 2000 and December 2011 who received treatment with sorafenib, HR, or TACE were included. Patients with main PVTT, superior mesenteric vein tumor thrombosis, or Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class C were excluded. The records of 172 patients were analyzed retrospectively. HR, TACE, and sorafenib treatment were performed is 40, 80, and 52 patients respectively. PVTT was classified as either involving the segmental branch (type I) or extending to involve the right or left portal vein (type II).
Results: The median survival time was significantly longer in the HR group (19.9 months) than in the TACE and sorafenib groups (6.6 and 6.2 months, respectively; both P<0.001), and did not differ significantly between the latter two groups (P=0.698). Among patients with CTP class A, type I PVTT or unilobar-involved HCC, the median survival time was longer in the HR group than in the TACE and sorafenib groups (P=0.006). In univariate analyses, the initial treatment method, tumor size, PVTT type, involved lobe, CTP class, and presence of cirrhosis or ascites were correlated with overall survival. The significant prognostic factors for overall survival in Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis were initial treatment method (HR vs. TACE: hazard ratio=1.750, P=0.036; HR vs. sorafenib: hazard ratio=2.262, P=0.006), involved lobe (hazard ratio=1.705, P=0.008), PVTT type (hazard ratio=1.617, P=0.013), and CTP class (hazard ratio=1.712, P=0.012).
Conclusions: Compared with TACE or sorafenib, HR may prolong the survival of patients with HCC in cases of CTP class A, type I PVTT or unilobar-involved HCC."
430,Comparison of Wearable Activity Tracker with Actigraphy for Sleep Evaluation and Circadian Rest-Activity Rhythm Measurement in Healthy Young Adults,이현아,2017,대한신경정신의학회,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the applicability of data obtained from a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit Charge HR) to medical research. This was performed by comparing the wearable activity tracker (Fitbit Charge HR) with actigraphy (Actiwatch 2) for sleep evaluation and circadian rest-activity rhythm measurement.
Methods: Sixteen healthy young adults (female participants, 62.5%; mean age, 22.8 years) wore the Fitbit Charge HR and the Actiwatch 2 on the same wrist; a sleep log was recorded over a 14-day period. We compared the sleep variables and circadian rest-activity rhythm measures with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Spearman’s correlations.
Results: The periods and acrophases of the circadian rest-activity rhythms and the sleep start times did not differ and correlated significantly between the Fitbit Charge HR and the Actiwatch 2. The Fitbit Charge HR tended to overestimate the sleep durations compared with the Actiwatch 2. However, the sleep durations showed high correlation between the two devices for all days.
Conclusion: We found that the Fitbit Charge HR showed high accuracy in sleep evaluation and circadian rest-activity rhythm measurement when compared with actigraphy for healthy young adults. The results suggest that the Fitbit Charge HR could be applicable on medical research as an alternative tool to actigraphy for sleep evaluation and measurement of the circadian rest-activity rhythm."
431,Post-resection prognosis of patients with hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma,Byeong-Gon Na,2021,대한외과학회,"Purpose: Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare borderline vascular tumor. This retrospective, single-center study evaluated the outcomes of hepatic resection (HR) in patients with hepatic EHE.
Methods: Over the 10-year period from 2009 to 2018, 11 patients with hepatic EHE underwent HR, accounting for 0.1% of the 11,979 adults who underwent HR at our center. Diagnosis of hepatic EHE was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for CD34, CD31, and factor VIII-related antigen.
Results: The 11 patients included 9 females (81.8%) and 2 males (18.2%) with mean age of 43.5 ± 13.6 years. Preoperative imaging resulted in a preliminary diagnosis of suspected liver metastasis or EHE, with 9 patients (81.8%) undergoing liver biopsy. No patient presented with abnormally elevated concentrations of liver tumor markers. The extents of HR were determined by tumor size and location from trisectionectomy to partial hepatectomy. All patients recovered uneventfully from HR. Five patients showed tumor recurrence, with 4 receiving locoregional treatments for recurrent lesions. The 1-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 90.9%, 54.5%, and 54.5%, respectively. Currently, all patients remain alive and are doing well. Univariate analysis on tumor recurrence showed that tumor size ≥ 4 cm was significantly associated with tumor recurrence (P = 0.032), but tumor number ≥ 4 was not related to (P = 0.24).
Conclusion: Hepatic EHE is a rare form of primary liver tumor often misdiagnosed as a metastatic tumor. Because of its malignant potential, HR is indicated if possible. HR plus, when necessary, treatment of recurrence yields favorable overall survival rates in patients with hepatic EHE."

433,Reconstruction Algorithms Infl uence the Follow-Up Variability in the Longitudinal CT Emphysema Index Measurements,Bruno Hochhegger,2011,대한영상의학회,"Objective: We wanted to compare the variability in the longitudinal emphysema index (EI) measurements that were computed with standard and high resolution (HR) reconstruction algorithms (RAs).
Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 475 patients who underwent CT for surveillance of lung nodules. From this cohort, 50 patients (28 male) were included in the study. For these patients, the baseline and followup scans were acquired on the same multidetector CT scanner and using the same acquisition protocol. The CT scans were reconstructed with HR and standard RAs. We determined the difference in the EI between CT1 and CT2 for the HR and standard RAs, and we compared the variance of these differences.
Results: The mean of the variation of the total lung volume was 0.14 L (standard deviation [SD] = 0.13 L) for the standard RA and 0.16 L (SD = 0.15 L) for the HR RA. These differences were not signifi cant. For the standard RA, the mean variation was 0.13% (SD = 0.44%) for EI -970 and 0.4% (SD = 0.88%) for EI -950; for the HR RA, the mean variation was 1.9% (SD = 2.2%) for EI -970 and 3.6% (SD = 3.7%) for EI -950. These differences were signifi cant.
Conclusion: Using an HR RA appears to increase the variability of the CT measurements of the EI."

The maximum permissible level for HW and HR to human dermal fibroblasts was over 200 μg/mL. In the experiment of type-I procollagen synthetic ability, at the concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50 and 100μg/mL, HW increased it by 26.3 (p<0.05), 43.8 (p<0.01), 52.0 (p<0.001) and 52.0% (p<0.001), and HR significantly (p<0.001) increased it by 53.6, 54.2, 54.7 and 56.9%, respectively, compared to the control group. In the experiment of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)activity, at the concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL, HW significantly (p<0.001) decreased it by 29.6, 32.9, 36.1 and 38.0%,and HR significantly (p<0.001) decreased it by 28.5, 30.1, 31.5 and 34.3%, respectively, compared to the control group. These results showed that HW and HR had very low toxicity to human dermal fibroblasts, and had high efficacy on the stimulation of collagen synthesis and inhibition of collagen degradation in human dermal fibroblasts. Taken the results in consideration, HW and HR could be used as functional cosmetic materials for the prevention or alleviation of skin aging induced by ultraviolet rays."
435,글자 영상을 위한 학습기반 초고해상도 기법,허보영,2015,대한전자공학회,"본 논문은 글자 영상을 효과적으로 확대 (up-scaling)하기 위한 학습 기반 초고해상도 (super-resolution; SR) 기법을 제안한다. 제안 기법은 크게 학습 단계와 합성 단계로 나뉜다. 학습 단계에서 다양한 HR (high-resolution) /LR (low-resolution) 글자 영상 쌍들을 수집한다. LR영상들은 양자화를 하고, 충분히 많은 수의 HR-LR 블록쌍들을 추출한다. 양자화된 LR블록을기준으로 블록 쌍들을 소정의 개수의 클래스들로 구분한다. 클래스 별로 최적의 2D-FIR 필터 계수를 계산하고, 양자화한 후색인용 LR 블록과 함께 사전에 저장한다. 합성 단계에서 입력 LR 영상 내 각 블록을 양자화한 후 사전 내 양자화된 LR블록들과 정합하여 가장 근사한 블록에 대응하는 FIR 필터계수를 선정한다. 마지막으로 선택된 FIR필터로 HR 블록을 합성하여최종적인 HR영상을 생성한다. 또한, 우리는 잡음이 있는 글자 영상에 대응하기 위해 학습과정에서 잡음 세기에 따른 복수개의사전들을 제작한다. 입력 LR 영상의 잡음 레벨에 맞는 사전을 선택하여 HR영상을 합성한다. 실험 결과는 제안 기법이 종래기법보다 잡음이 없는 환경에서는 물론 잡음이 있는 환경에서 우수한 주관적/객관적 화질을 가짐을 보인다.The proposed algorithm consists of two stages: the learning and synthesis stages. At the learning stage, we first collect various high-resolution (HR)-low-resolution (LR) text image pairs, and quantize the LR images, and extract HR-LR block pairs. Based on quantized LR blocks, the LR-HR block pairs are clustered into a pre-determined number of classes. For each class, an optimal 2D-FIR filter is computed, and it is stored into a dictionary with the corresponding LR block for indexing. At the synthesis stage, each quantized LR block in an input LR image is compared with every LR block in the dictionary, and the FIR filter of the best-matched LR block is selected. Finally, a HR block is synthesized with the chosen filter, and a final HR image is produced. Also, in order to cope with noisy environment, we generate multiple dictionaries according to noise level at the learning stage. So, the dictionary corresponding to the noise level of the input image is chosen, and a final HR image is produced using the selected dictionary. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the previous works for noisy images as well as noise-free images."
436,Ramie Leaf Extracts Suppresses Adipogenic Differentiation in 3T3-L1 Cells and Pig Preadipocytes,이주민 /JOOMIN LEE,2016,아세아·태평양축산학회,"The present study was carried out to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of different concentrations of extracts of hot airdried ramie leaf (HR) and freeze-dried ramie leaf (FR) in 3T3-L1 cells and pig preadipocytes. To analyze the effect on cell proliferation, cells were treated with 25 μg/mL or 100 μg/mL HR or FR extract for 2 days. Cell differentiation was evaluated by measuring glycerol-3- phosphate dehydrogenase and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activities and intracellular triglyceride content. Treatment with either HR or FR extracts inhibited the proliferation of 3T3-L1 cells and pig preadipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. HR extract treatment inhibited the differentiation of both cell types more effectively than FR treatment. The extent of triglyceride accumulation decreased significantly in both cells following either HR or FR treatment. Furthermore, LPL activity significantly decreased after treatment with HR or FR extract.
These results indicated that HR and FR extracts may inhibit proliferation and differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and pig preadipocytes.
Further studies are needed to explore the anti-obesity effect of HR and FR extracts."

Lines,김용덕,2011,경상국립대학교 농업생명과학연구원,"In this study, 160 tea tree (Camellia sinensis L.) lines were classified by caffeine content using colorimetric methods. Among them, caffeine-rich lines (HR-78, HR-137, HR-82 and HR-123) and poor lines (HP-85, HP-88, HP-19, and HP-131) were selected. To know the difference in morphological and genetic characters between caffeine-rich and poor lines, we used leaf/shoot growth and RAPD methods. Cluster pattern of morphological characters (leaf width, leaf length, leaf area and shoot length) showed that shoot length was longer in caffein-rich lines than in -poor lines. In genetic analysis, amplified DNA bands having various sizes were detected in RAPD analysis where 30 random primers were used. However, the discriminated primer set that distinguish caffein-rich tree line from -poor lines was not found. These results can be used as the basic data to determine the morphological and genetic differences among caffein-rich and -poor lines"

배추김치는 조제 후 15℃에서 각 시간 별로 익힘 과정을 거친 후 －1.4℃의 김치냉장고에 60일까지 보관하였다. 본 실험에 사용한 시료는 익힘시간에 따라서 32 hr(S1), 36 hr(S2), 40 hr(S3), 44 hr(S4), 48 hr(S5)라 명명하였다. 김치냉장고 보관모드로 전환하기 전 15℃에서의 저장 시간을 상대적으로 길게 준 S5구에서 S1, S2구에 비하여 pH 감소가 좀 더 큰 것으로 나타났으며, 보관 시간이 지남에 따라 pH가 4.3~4.4까지낮아지는 것을 알 수 있었다. 젖산농도의 경우 15℃에서의 저장 시간을 상대적으로 길게 준 S5구에서 젖산농도 증가가 좀더 큰 것으로 나타났으며, 보관 시간이 지남에 따라 젖산농도는 0.70~0.74까지 증가하는 것을 알 수 있었다. 유산균의 경우모든 시료가 저장 초기 20일 경과까지 수가 급격히 증가하였고, 20일 이후에는 S4, S5 시료가 S1, S2, S3 시료에 비하여좀 더 증대되는 경향을 보였다. 유산균 속은 저장 40일 기준으로 S5 시료에서 바이셀라 속 균이 50% 이상 검출되었다.
오르니틴 함량은 모든 시료에서 저장 40~50일차에 최대치를보였으며, S4, S5 시료의 경우 오르니틴 함량은 100그램당 최대 130 ㎎과 170 ㎎까지 증대되었다. 그러나 S1, S2, S3 시료의 경우는 오르니틴 함량 증대 폭이 상대적으로 적었다. 이들결과로부터 김치냉장고 조건에서 김치를 저장하기 전 15℃ 조건에서 44~48시간을 발효한 후 김치냉장고에 40~50일 보관하면 김치 100그램 중의 오르니틴 함량을 최대 130~170 ㎎까지증대시킬 수 있을 것으로 판단되며, 그 중에서도 S5 (48 hr) 조건이 가장 우수한 것으로 조사되었다.Changes in fermentation properties and ornithine levels of Baechu Kimchi by storage conditions were investigated. Aftermaking and fermenting Kimchi at 15℃ for 32 hr (S1), 36 hr (S2), 40 hr (S3), 44 hr (S4), and 48 hr (S5) during the first10 days of storage. The Kimchi samples are subsequently stored in the －1℃ Kimchi refrigerator for up to 60 days. Changesin the pH values and lactic acid contents of S4 and S5 samples are slightly bigger than the S1, S2 and S3 samples whichhave no significance differences. According to lactic acid bacteria (LAB) number, all samples show the largest augmentationaccording to the number of Lactobacilli during the first 20 days of storage. After 20 days of storage, the S4 and S5 samplesshow larger accumulations of LAB than S1, S2 and S3 samples. The Weissella genus is predominated at the 40 day ofstorage in the S5 sample. Ornithine levels are increased up to 170 ㎎ per 100 g during the storage period of 40~50 daysin the S5 sample. However, the increase of ornithine levels in S1, S2 and S3 samples is smaller than those of the S4 andS5 samples. These results indicate that the conditions of Kimchi fermentation, which is 48 hr at 15℃ before storage, isproved to be the most superior for ornithine levels within the Kimchi refrigerator."

[방법] 총 107명(남성: 55명, 여성: 52명)의 연구대상자는 신체구성 측정 후 운동부하테스트와 두 번의 1,600 m 걷기(빠르게 걷기, 일정속도 걷기)에 참여하였다. 연구대상자의 연령과 신체적 특성, 그리고 걷기 시 측정된 시간, heart rate (HR), 또는 HR과 activity count per minute (ACM)의 비율(HR/ACM)을 변인으로 회귀분석을 시행하였다. 개발된 추정식의 타당도 검증을 위하여 직접법에 의한 VO2max와 추정식에 의한 VO2max의 상관관계분석과 예측잔차합제곱(predicted residual sum of squares)를 시행하였다. 또한, 직접법에 의한 VO2max와 추정식에 의한 VO2max의 차이를 분석하기 위하여 Bland-Altman plotting과 선형회귀분석을 실시하였다. [결과] 구간별(400 m, 800 m, 1,200 m, 1,600 m) HR/ACM과 걷기시간이 성별, 연령과 함께 직접법에 의한 VO2max와 유의한 상관관계가 나타났다. 모든 구간에서 추정식이 개발되었으나 400m에서만 직접법에 의한 VO2max와 차이가 없었다(R2: 0.675, %SEE: 10.7).

[Methods] One hundred seven participants (55 male, 52 female) performed a graded exercise test to determine VO2max and two types of 1,600 m walk exercises (fast walk and pace controlled walk). The equations for estimating VO2max was developed by stepwise multiple regression. The validity of developed equations tested through the correlation between measured VO2max and estimated VO2max, was assessed by predicted residual sum of squares, and Bland-Altman plotting. [Results] VO2max was correlated with time, and HR/activity count per minute (ACM) measured in pace controlled walk exercise at all distance (400 m, 800 m, 1,200 m, 1,600 m). The equations were valid significantly and their multiple correlation coefficients or standard estimated error were similar to that Åstrand-Rhyming cycle ergometer test or Rockport 1 mile walk test. Using HR/ACM in pace controlled walk (400 m), it was possible to estimate VO2max (R2: 0.675, %SEE: 10.7). The equation was: VO2max=121.659+6.656×Gender-0.865×Age-9.540×Time-2460.952×HR/ACM (Gender, 0=female, 1=male: Time, hundredth of a minute: HR, heart rate: ACM, activity count per minute). [Conclusion] Estimation equations developed in this study are considered to estimate VO2max through a shorter distance, or a lower intensity of walk exercise. It is required studies to target a wide range of ages or to develop walk test on a lower bpm.VO2max, cardiorespiratory fitness, accelerometer"
441,The Relationship between the Breast Arterial Calcification Detected by Mammography and the Hypertensive Retinopathy in Hypertensive Women,Cuneyt Calisir,2008,대한영상의학회,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the breast arterial calcification (BAC) detected by mammograms and the hypertensive retinopathy (HR) in hypertensive women who underwent ophthalmologic examination.
Materials and Methods: Screening mammography was performed in 99 hypertensive women and these women also underwent an ophthalmologic examination. The presence of arterial calcification and the number of calcified blood vessels in each breast were evaluated. The grade of HR was determined. The presence of BAC and the number of blood vessels involved was compared according to the presence of HR and the grade of HR.
Results: Among the 99 patients, HR was detected in 70 patients, and of these 70 patients, 42 patients had grade I HR and 28 had grade II HR. BAC was detected in 54 cases. Forty-six patients with HR (66%) and eight patients without HR (27%) were diagnosed with BAC after they underwent mammographic examination. The prevalence of BAC in the subjects who had HR was statistically higher than that in those subjects who did not have HR (p < 0.01). The grade of HR was not significantly associated with BAC (p > 0.05). The positive predictive value of the BAC detected on mammography for HR was 0.80 in those subjects who were 60 years old.
Conclusion: The detection of BAC by mammography is associated with an increased risk of HR, and particularly for patients after the age of 60. The findings of BAC may be related to hypertensive end-organ damage, and performing mammograms might contribute to predicting the presence of ophthalmologic hypertensive complications in these patients.Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the breast arterial calcification (BAC) detected by mammograms and the hypertensive retinopathy (HR) in hypertensive women who underwent ophthalmologic examination.

Flower bud differentiation was induced by only day-length extension treatment (18 hr light/day) in early - and medium-maturing cultivars. Therefore, the early- and medium-maturing cultivars of radish were advanced the time of the flowering by the 2 weeks low temperature duration with day-length extension (18 hr light/day). The vegetative growth of early- and medium-maturing cultivar was the best by only day-length extension (18 hr light/day). However, late-maturing cultivar was needed for the flower bud differentiation and optimal vegetative growth not only long-day but also low temperature during 4~6 weeks at least.

NH3-N은 HRT 9hr 이상에서는 95% 이상의 높은 제거효율을 나타냈으며, T-N 제거효율은 HRT 9∼12hr에서 67.6∼76.7%, HRT 6hr에서는 50%로 감소되었는데 이는 탈질에 필요한 탄소원이 부족하기 때문이다. 운전기간동안 T-P 제거효율은 평균 32%로 낮게 조사되었는데 강화되는 법적기준을 준수하기 위해서는 반응조 후단에 화학적 인 제거 공정이 필요한 것으로 사료된다.An evaluation of the organic matter removal efficiency showed high removal efficiencies of 91.1∼96.3% and 91.4∼97.5% for TCODcr and TBOD5, respectively, for 9hr or longer of HRT. However, the removal efficiencies decreased to 86.9∼90.5% and 88.0∼90.9%, respectively for 6hr of HRT. NH3-N showed a high removal efficiency of 95% or higher for 9hr or longer of HRT. The total nitrogen removal efficiency was 67.6∼76.7% for 9∼12hr of HRT, and it decreased to 50% for 6hr of HRT, which seems to be due to the insufficient carbon source required for denitrification. The T-P removal efficiency was 32% on average. To comply with the legal standards, a chemical phosphorus removal process is needed after the reactor."

448,Blunting effect of dexmedetomidine on transient cardiovascular changes induced by inhalation of desflurane: a randomized controlled trial,장명수 /Myung-Soo Jang,2018,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: A rapid increase in desflurane concentration has been demonstrated to induce transient sympathetic hyperactivity and lead to increases in blood pressure and heart rate (HR). Additionally, the use of dexmedetomidine as an anesthetic adjunct has been reported to attenuate intraoperative sympathetic responses. We examined the hemodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine infusion before anesthetic induction on desflurane-induced cardiovascular changes.
Methods: Patients were randomly divided into three groups. They received either normal saline (NS) (group 1, only NS) or dexmedetomidine solution diluted in 50 ml NS (group 2, 0.5 mg/kg; group 3, 1.0 mg/kg) for 10 minutes with a syringe pump before anesthetic induction. Desflurane was administered at a vaporizer dial setting of 8% for 5 minutes by manual ventilation.
Results: In group 1, the HR significantly increased above the baseline during the entire 5 minutes after desflurane inhalation and the mean blood pressure (MBP) significantly increased above the baseline at 1, 2, and 3 minutes after desflurane inhalation. However, in groups 2 and 3, the increases in HR and MBP induced by desflurane inhalation were significantly suppressed. The HR and MBP in group 2 remained closer to the baseline than in group 3.
Conclusions: A loading infusion of dexmedetomidine for 10 minutes before induction of general anesthesia effectively attenuates the transient cardiovascular stimulation induced by desflurane inhalation, without significant hemodynamic side effects. The HR and MBP remained closer to the baseline after administration of 0.5 mg/kg dexmedetomidine than after administration of a dose of 1.0 mg/kg."
449,Clinical Implications of Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Status after 5-Year Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Late Recurrence of Hormone Receptor-positive Breast Cancer,Seung Taek Lim,2020,한국유방암학회,"Purpose: The prognostic implications of serum vitamin D status after a 5-year adjuvant endocrine therapy on the risk of late recurrence among hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer patients remain unclear. Hence, we investigated this among Korean HR-positive breast cancer patients.
Methods: A total of 455 patients with HR-positive stage I–III invasive breast cancer who underwent curative surgery at St. Vincent's Hospital between February 2004 and April 2012 were included in this retrospective study. Patients were categorized based on their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels after the 5-year adjuvant endocrine therapy. Initial recurrence sites were categorized. The primary clinical outcome was late recurrence-free survival (LRFS).
Results: Among the 455 patients, 242 and 213 were included in the 25(OH)D-deficient group and 25(OH)D-sufficient group, respectively. Forty-eight patients experienced late recurrence. Across all recurrence sites, the 25(OH)D-deficient group showed significantly worse LRFS rates than the 25(OH)D-sufficient group (hazard ratio [HR], 2.284; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.155–4.515; p = 0.018). After patient subgrouping based on recurrence site, the 25(OH)D-deficient group also showed significantly worse LRFS rates in terms of regional lymph node (LN) (HR, 17.453; 95% CI, 2.46–128.83; p = 0.005), bone (HR, 2.394; 95% CI, 1.024–5.599; p = 0.044), and visceral (HR, 2.735; 95% CI, 1.182–6.328; p = 0.019) recurrence. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of local recurrence (p = 0.611).
Conclusions: We found that 25(OH)D deficiency after the 5-year adjuvant endocrine therapy was associated with worse LRFS among HR-positive breast cancer patients, particularly with respect to regional LN, bone, and visceral recurrence."
450,Psycho-Physiological Responses to a 4-Month High-Intensity Interval Training-Centered Multidisciplinary Weight-Loss Intervention in Adolescents with Obesity,Marwa Khammassi,2020,대한비만학회,"Background: To evaluate the impact of 4 months of a high-intensity interval training (HIIT)-centered weight-management intervention on health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), health perception (HP) and physical self-perception (PSP) in adolescents with obesity.
Methods: Fifty-six adolescents with obesity (28 girls; mean body mass index [BMI], 35±4.89 kg/m2; z-BMI, 2.3±0.3; 11–17 years) followed a multidisciplinary weight-management intervention composed of nutritional counseling, HIIT program, and health-related therapeutic education. Anthropometric parameters, body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry), and maximal aerobic capacities (maximal oxygen consumption [VO2peak]) were assessed, and self-reported questionnaires were used to assess HR-QOL (36-item short form survey), HP and PSP at baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1).
Results: Body weight (92.6±18.9 to 85.9±16.2 kg), BMI (35.0±4.8 to 32.1±4.5 kg/m²), z-BMI (2.3±0.3 to 2.1±0.3) and fat mass percentage (36.0%±9.1% to 30.4%±7.8%) were significantly decreased (P<0.001) between T0 and T1. There was a tendency for VO2peak to increase from 26.35±5.81 mL/kg/min at T0 to 28.79±6.59 mL/kg/min at T1 (P=0.06). Physical functioning (P=0.002), physical limitation (P=0.048), general health (P<0.001) and bodily pain (P=0.030) were improved at T1. A significant improvement occurred in dimensions of HP such as physical condition (P=0.001), adiposity (P<0.001), alimentation (P<0.001), general health (P=0.038), and perceived general health (P=0.001). In addition, there was an improvement in items of PSP such as self-perceived coordination (P=0.022), endurance (P=0.001) and activity (P=0.001), global self-concept (P=0.015), and appearance (P=0.016). Physical but not mental HR-QOL domains, HP and PSP were associated with weight reduction.
Conclusion: While HIIT favors improved HR-QOL, HP status and PSP in adolescents with obesity, physical but not mental HR-QOL, HP and PSP were associated with weight reduction."
451,Promotion of Cervical Screening among Long-term Nonattendees by Human Papillomavirus Self-sampling,Avalon Ernstson,2021,대한암예방학회,"Cervical cancer is preventable through gynecological screening. To promote participation among non-attending women, self-collected vaginal samples for detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) is an option. The aims of this study were to investigate the response of self-collected vaginal samples for hr-HPV testing among long-term non-attendees, to explore the attendance at follow-up among HPV-positive women, and to analyze the prevalence of hr-HPV and severe cervical dysplasia or cancer among the responders. A vaginal self-sampling kit was sent to 19,766 women aged 30-70 years who had not provided a cervical screening sample for ≥ 7 years in Skåne, Sweden. The self-sample was analyzed by the Aptima HPV mRNA assay (Hologic). Women testing positive for HPV were invited for follow-up. The response was 18.5% (3,646/19,757). The prevalence of HPV mRNA was 11.3% (412/3,636). Among HPV-positive women, 85.7% (353/412) attended follow-up, and of these, 44.8% (158/353) had HPV in the cervical sample. The HPV mRNA test of self-samples showed a positive predictive value of 9.3% ([33/353], 95% CI = 6.5-12.9) for detection of cytologically severe dysplasia. Histologically severe dysplasia or cancer was detected in 0.88% ([32/3,636], 95% CI = 0.6-1.2) among responders, including two cervical- and one vaginal cancer. In conclusion, almost one fifth of the long-term non-attendees participated in self-collected vaginal hr-HPV sampling. The prevalence of histologically confirmed high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or cervical cancer was not increased significantly compared to regularly screened women in Sweden. The relatively high HPV prevalence among the self-samples indicates the importance of diagnostic follow-up with cervical HPV testing and reflex-cytology of HPV-positive cases.

However, poor prognosis is conferred on patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. We aimed to examine weakly positive HR breast cancer by comparing weakly positive HR to strongly positive HR and negative HR breast cancer. Methods: We examined the clinical and biological features of 1,496 women with breast cancer, and these patients were categorized according to HR status as weakly positive, strongly positive, and negative HR breast cancer. Results: In this study, among 1,496 patients with breast cancer, negative HR breast cancer was found in 374, weakly positive HR breast cancer in 90 and strongly positive HR breast cancer in 1,032 patients. Our multivariate analysis showed that there were differences in T stage, tumor–node–metastasis stage, vascular invasion, histologic grade and type, and Ki-67 index. Patients with weakly positive HR breast cancer had an increased risk of death and recurrence compared with those with strongly positive HR breast cancer and had similar prognosis as patients with negative HR breast cancer. Conclusion: Patients with weakly positive HR breast cancer received endocrine therapy because they were regarded as having positive HR breast cancer. However, their prognosis of overall survival and relapse-free survival was similar to that in patients with negative HR breast cancer. Therefore, we need to closely observe and consider active treatment for patients with weakly positive breast cancer."

Dried food wastes andagricultural wastes were used for the experiments and the heated-air torrefaction characteristicswere investigated by the raw materials, torrefaction air temperature, and torrefaction time. Forthe dried agricultural wastes, measured torrefaction capacity and lower heating values were 55.35kg/hr and 3,333 kcal/kg, respectively. As the lower heating values of the treated samples weregreater, by around 7.8%, than those of the non-treated samples, torrefaction process was a veryeffective method to increase the heating value of the agricultural waste. In case of the driedfood waste, torrefaction capacity and lower heating value was measured 88.27 kg/hr and 4,016kcal/kg, respectively. As the lower heating value of treated ones showed around 9.0% higherthan that of non treated ones, torrefaction process is very effective method to increase theheating value of the agricultural waste also. It will be assumed that the heating value showsmore higher as increase the air temperature and decrease the moisture content of torrified matter.Agricultural waste, Food waste, Lower heating value, Torrefaction, Torrefaction unit"
460,The Relationship between Autonomic Regulation of Cardiovascular Function and Body Composition,Tomislav Smoljo,2020,대한비만학회,"Background: We investigated whether the results of autonomic function tests correlate with body composition and shape in healthy young people.
Methods: We conducted cardiovascular reflex tests (heart rate [HR] and blood pressure [BP] responses to the Valsalva maneuver and HR response to deep breathing) and the tilt table test with 32 subjects (19 males; mean age, 22.1±1.9 years). Participants also completed an anthropometric measurement sequence (weight; height; upper arm, hips, and waist circumference; triceps and subscapular skinfold), bioelectric impedance testing, and hand grip strength measurements.
Results: Markers of obesity, other anthropometric measures, functional measures, and the basal metabolic rate (BMR) were significantly positively correlated with systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) in both the supine and tilted positions. There was a positive correlation between the difference in HR (ΔHR) between the tilt and supine body positions and markers of obesity, the functional marker of dominant handgrip strength, and BMR. Participants with a body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m2 had significantly lower median values of ΔHR, DBP in the tilt-test, SBP at rest, and SBP in the tilt-test than participants who had a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (10.55 vs. 21.95 bpm, P=0.003; 77.55 vs. 90.05 mmHg, P=0.045; 113.45 vs. 140.55 mmHg, P=0.013; 117.00 vs. 135.25 mmHg, P=0.006, respectively). Body fat percentage was identified as an independent positive predictor (β=0.993; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.070 to 1.916; P=0.036) and body water percentage was an independent negative predictor of tilted SBP (β=–1.370; 95% CI, –2.634 to 0.106; P=0.035).
Conclusion: High sympathetic activity, as evaluated by cardiovascular regulation, correlates with a high share of adipose tissue in young healthy persons."

To test their potential as starters for cheonggukjang, soybean was fermented for 72 hr at 37oC with each isolate and a control lab strain: B. subtilis CH3-25 (BS3-25), B. amyloliquefaciens CH51 (BA51), B. amyloliquefaciens CH86-1 (BA86-1), and B. subtilis 168 (BS168, control, lab strain). Viable cell numbers of all cheonggukjang samples rapidly increased and reached about 109 CFU/g after 6 hr. During 72 hr, the initial pH of 6.3 rapidly increased to 8.1~8.2 for cheonggukjang fermented with BS3-25 or BA86-1, and 7.3 for those with BA51 or BS168. FAs and protease activities (acid, neutral, and alkaline) rapidly increased in cheonggukjang fermented with BS3-25, BA51, or BA86-1 during the first 12 hr. On the other hand, those of cheonggukjang fermented with BS168 slightly increased during the first 36 hr. There were significant changes in acid and neutral protease activities in cheonggukjang fermented with BA51 or BA86-1 during the 24 hr. Rapid increases of β-glucosidase activity corresponded well with rapid increases of α-amylase and α-galactosidase activities in addition to increases in antioxidant activities and the TPCs (total phenolic contents). The highest increase in the TPCs was observed in cheonggukjang fermented with BA86-1 while the least was that fermented with BS168."

황 탈질조의 탈질효율 검토결과, 유입 T-N 농도 20mg/L 이하에서는 EBCT 1hr, 30mg/L에서는 EBCT 2∼3hr가 최적 EBCT로 조사되었다. 또한 그 이상의 T-N이 유입될 경우 생물학적 처리공정으로 반송을 통하여, 유입 T-N 농도를 30mg/L 이하로 유지해야 한다. 질소 부하에 따른 탈질효율 검토결과, 유입부하를 0.496kg/m3·day 이내로 유지하였을 때 방류수질 기준을 만족하였지만, 현장 적용시 반응조 용적이 증가되는 문제점이 발생하기 때문에 탈질효율과 경제성을 고려하였을 때 유입부하를 0.372 kg/m3·day이내로 운전해야 한다.
황 탈질 반응속도 상수를 산정한 결과, 유입부하 0.248∼0.628kg/m3·day에서 k은 0.0890∼0.5032hr⁻¹로 유기물 생분해도의 반응속도 상수보다 높게 조사되었다. Cl⁻ 농도에 따른 회분식 실험 결과, 유입 질소농도 30.0mg/L 에서 염분농도 7,000mgCl⁻/L 이하에서는 탈질효율의 영향은 크지 않으나, 9,000mgCl⁻/L 이상에서는 저해가 발생하는 것으로 조사되었다. 연속식 반응실험에서 Cl⁻ 농도에 따른 반응속도 상수 산정결과, raw wastewater∼5,000mgCl⁻/L에서의 반응속도 상수는 0.1049∼0.2324 hr⁻¹로 조사되었다. 그러나 7,000mgCl⁻/L의 경우 k은 0.1588 hr⁻¹로, 9,000mgCl⁻/L는 k은 0.1049 hr⁻¹로 염분 농도가 증가할수록 반응속도 상수는 감소되었다.This study examined the effects of the salinity of seafood wastewater on the sulfur denitrification process.
An examination of the denitrification efficiency showed that the optimal EBCT was 1hr at an influent T-N concentration of 20mg/L or lower and 2-3hr at an T-N concentration of 30mg/L.
An examination of the denitrification efficiency according to the nitrogen load showed that the legal effluent water quality criterion was satisfied when the influent load was maintained within 0.496kg/㎥/day. On the other hand, the reactor volume increased when this was applied to the site. Therefore, the influent load should be within 0.372kg/㎥/day considering the denitrification and economic efficiency.At a load of 0.248∼0.628kg/㎥·day, the k value was 0.0890∼0.5032hr⁻¹. The batch experimental results according to the Cl⁻ concentration showed that at an influent nitrogen concentration of 30.0mg/L, the effect of the denitrification efficiency was not large below the salinity of 7,000mgCl⁻/L, but inhibition occurred above 9,000mgCl⁻/L. Calculations of the reaction rate constant according to the Cl⁻concentration showed that the reaction rate constant was 0.1049∼0.2324hr⁻¹ at a raw wastewater concentration of ∼5,000mgCl⁻/L. In contrast, the k value was 0.1588hr⁻¹ at 7,000mgCl⁻/L and 0.1049hr⁻¹ at 9,000mgCl⁻/L"
465,Dynamic CT Myocardial Perfusion Imaging in Patients without Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease: Quantification of Myocardial Blood Flow according to Varied Heart Rate Increments after Stress,Yu Lihua,2021,대한영상의학회,"Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the association between myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantified by dynamic CT myocardial perfusion imaging (CT-MPI) and the increments in heart rate (HR) after stress in patients without obstructive coronary artery disease.
Materials and Methods: We retrospectively included 204 subjects who underwent both dynamic CT-MPI and coronary CT angiography (CCTA). Patients with more than minimal coronary stenosis (diameter ≥ 25%), history of myocardial infarction/ revascularization, cardiomyopathy, and microvascular dysfunction were excluded. Global MBF at stress was measured using hybrid deconvolution and maximum slope model. Furthermore, the HR increments after stress were recorded.
Results: The median radiation dose of dynamic CT-MPI plus CCTA was 5.5 (4.5–6.8) mSv. The median global MBF of all subjects was 156.4 (139.8–180.4) mL/100 mL/min. In subjects with HR increment between 10 to 19 beats per minute (bpm), the global MBF was significantly lower than that of subjects with increment between 20 to 29 bpm (153.3 mL/100 mL/min vs. 171.3 mL/100 mL/min, p = 0.027). This difference became insignificant when the HR increment further increased to ≥ 30 bpm.
Conclusion: The global MBF value was associated with the extent of increase in HR after stress. Significantly higher global MBF was seen in subjects with HR increment of ≥ 20 bpm."

natural gas and naptha. We evaluate the economic feasibility of on-site hydrogen stations with hydrogen production
capacities of 30Nm3/hr, 100Nm3/hr and 300 Nm3/hr. We build a classical economic feasibility model
and we make some sensitivity analyses by changing the values of input factors such as the hydrogen sale
price and the discount rate. The estimated hydrogen prices of steam methane reforming stations with production
capacities of 30 Nm3/hr, 100 Nm3/hr and 300 Nm3/hr are 18,472 won/kg, 10,689 won/kg and
7,758 won/kg, respectively. Also, the hydrogen prices are about the same if we use naptha as a raw material
for hydrogen energy instead of natural gas. It turns out that small and medium size domestic on-site hydrogen
stations will not be economical in the near future. This indicates that we need to construct large scale
on-site hydrogen fueling stations even for the initial phase of the hydrogen economy.This paper deals with the economy of scale for domestic on-site hydrogen stations fueled with

For total phenolic compounds content, the optimal extraction temperature, time and amount of solvent per sample were 94.50℃, 2.06 hr and 25.03 ml/g, respectively. Also, the optimal conditions for electronic donating ability were 91.82℃, 2.90 hr and 20.88 ml/g, respectively. The nitrile scavenging ability (pH 1.2) was optimized using the extraction temperature of 97.36℃, extraction time 2.75 hr and 15.19 ml/g as the amount of solvent per sample. Regression equations of total phenolic compounds content, electron donating ability and nitrile scavenging ability as dependent variable were deduced from each analyzed extraction condition. And finally, their response surfaces were superimposed with the optimal conditions to obtain values for each extraction process factor.

468,Human Resource Management in Nepal: A Delphi Study,Arun Gurung,2019,한국유통과학회,"Purpose - This study aims to explore and describe human resource management (HRM) in Nepalese organizations.
Specifically, this study addresses three research questions: (a) what are the key human resource (HR) practices in Nepalese organizations?; (b) what are the major tasks and roles of HR departments in Nepalese organizations?; and (c) how is the status of the HR function expected to change within Nepalese organizations? Research design, data, and methodology - For this purpose, we implemented the Delphi method and developed an informed consensus among selected experts concerning the research questions.
Results - The findings illustrate that organizations in Nepal adopt a wide range of HR practices commonly used in Western and developed countries. Simultaneously, some HR practices specific to the Nepalese context are also discovered. The experts’ consensus on the future of HRM confirms that the evolution of the HR function to a strategic partner of management is evident in Nepalese organizations.
Conclusions – Domestic as well as foreign organizations in Nepal try to create HRM systems that place them on a par with global companies. At the same time, they incorporate cultural features specific to Nepal to compete effectively in local markets. While there are few empirical studies describing HR practices in Nepal, this study contributes to broadening our understanding of the current and future status of HRM in Nepal."

The selected tea tree lines, catechins-rich lines (HR-52, HR-29, HR-82, HR-123, and HR- 55) and catechins-poor lines (HP-19, HP-108, HP-138, HP-150, and HP-18), were analyzed through morphological (leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, and shoot length) and genetic analysis. The cluster pattern of morphological characters showed a positive correlation between the catechins contents and the leaf morphology. In RAPD analysis, the amplified DNA bands did not appear with 10 primers, however, the various sizes of DNA bands were detected with 22 primers. The special DNA bands between the rich and poor lines were not found. These results suggest that the morphological and genetic character may be somewhat related to secondary metabolites of tea trees."

Materials and Methods: This prospective study included 10 volunteers and 93 consecutive hypertension patients who had undergone SLEEK at 1.5T MRI system. Firstly, suitable BSP TIs for displaying clearly renal artery were determined in 10 volunteers. Secondly, non-contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography with the suitable BSP TIs were performed on those hypertension patients. Then, renal artery was evaluated and an optimal BSP TI to increase arterial visibility was determined for each patient. Patients’ BRs and HRs were recorded and their relationships with the optimal BSP TI were analyzed.
Results: The optimal BSP TI was negatively correlated with BR (r1 = -0.536, P1 < 0.001; and r2 = -0.535, P2 < 0.001) and HR (r1 = -0.432, P1 = 0.001; and r2 = -0.419, P2 = 0.001) for 2 readers (κ = 0.93). For improving renal arterial visibility, BSP TI = 800 ms could be applied as the optimal BSP TI when the 95% confidence interval were 17–19/min (BR1) and 74–82 bpm (HR1) for reader#1 and 17–19/min (BR2) and 74–83 bpm (HR2) for reader#2; BSP TI = 1100 ms while 14–15/min (BR1, 2) and 71–76 bpm (HR1, 2) for both readers; and BSP TI = 1400 ms when 13–16/min (BR1) and 63–68 bpm (HR1) for reader#1 and 14–15/min (BR2) and 64–70 bpm (HR2) for reader#2.
Conclusion: In SLEEK, BSP TI is affected by patients’ BRs and HRs. Adopting the optimal BSP TI based on BR and HR can improve the renal arterial visibility and consequently the working efficiency."

473,Appropriate treatment modality for solitary small hepatocellular carcinoma: Radiofrequency ablation vs. resection vs. transplantation?,Keun Soo Ahn,2019,대한간학회,"There has been controversy regarding the first-line treatment modality for the patients who have small solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), surgical hepatic resection (HR) and liver transplantation (LT). For selection of treatment modality of HCC, it should be considered of hepatic reservoir function as well as the tumor stage. If the liver function is good enough, HR may be the first choice regardless of the tumor size. However, recent studies comparing RFA with resection showed comparable outcome and similar survival rates. RFA, HR and LT provide good outcome for patients who have small HCCs. RFA would be desired in patients who have below 3.0 cm in size and low alpha-fetoprotein (<200 ng/mL). However, in small HCC with high tumor marker, HR should be considered. Better patient selection for the ‘resection first’ approach and early detection of recurrence can achieve better outcomes of the salvage LT strategy. Another benefit of resection first strategy is that it make possible to do enlist of LT for patients before recurrence at high risk of HCC recurrence after resection on the basis of pathologic aggressiveness, microvascular invasion and/or satellites nodule. They should be applied appropriately according to the tumor size, location, tumor markers and underlying liver parenchymal disease."

The initial microstructure of LPBF-SS316L exhibits a molten pool ~100 μm in size and grains grown along the building direction. Isotropic grains (~35 μm) are detected in the HR-SS316L. In high-temperature oxidation tests performed at 700oC and 900oC, LPBF-SS316L demonstrates slightly superior high-temperature oxidation resistance compared to HR-SS316L. After the initial oxidation at 700oC, shown as an increase in weight, almost no further oxidation is observed for both materials. At 900oC, the oxidation weight displays a parabolic trend and both materials exhibit similar behavior. However, at 1100oC, LPBF-SS316L oxidizes in a parabolic manner, but HR-SS316L shows a breakaway oxidation behavior. The oxide layers of LPBF-SS316L and HR-SS316L are mainly composed of Cr2O3, Febased oxides, and spinel phases. In LPBF-SS316L, a uniform Cr depletion region is observed, whereas a Cr depletion region appears at the grain boundary in HR-SS316L. It is evident from the results that the microstructure and the hightemperature oxidation characteristics and behavior are related."

Commercially available Nike + iPod Sports kit was used to compare energy expenditure with sensor module attached to their foot. Actual energy expenditure was determined by a continuous direct gas analyzer and two multiple regression equations of walking and running mode for different attaching position were developed. Results showed that estimation accuracy of energy expenditure using waist mounted accelerometer was higher than that of the top of the foot and Nike + iPod Sports kit. Results of energy expenditure based on waist and top of the foot showed that the crossover state of energy expenditure occurred at 7.5km/hr. But Nike + iPod Sports kit could not find intersection of energy expenditure in all nine subjects. Therefore the sensor module attached to the waist and separate multi regression equation by walking and running mode was the best to estimate more accurate prediction."

Maturation rate was significantly increased as culture period was increased to 36 hr (66.9%, p<0.05), and then gradually increased to 87.1% at 44 hr of IVM. The cdc2 kinase activity was decreased (p<0.05) with culture period prolonged from 36 hr to 44 hr. Lower blastocyst formation rate (4.3%, p<0.05) were obtained by ES in 36 hr-matured oocytes compared to other treatments (16.5 and 20.5%) in the same age and the same treatment in 44 hr-matured oocytes (15.0%). High blastocyst formation rate (23.6%) was obtained by ES+ES+D in 44 hr-matured oocytes (p<0.05). These results demonstrate that porcine oocyte activation and in vitro development of parthenotes can be affected by interactions between oocyte maturational age and activation condition."

However, excess nutrients can be washed off during a storm and affected on nearby waterbodies. In this paper, the runoff characteristics from farmland were studied to determine the washoff mass. A lab-scale reactor was designed to estimate the surface runoff and infiltration rates according to the rainfall intensity. Surface runoff water did not occur at 10mm/hr rainfall intensity, but some runoff occurred at 20mm/hr rainfall intensity. At 32.4mm/hr rainfall intensity, it shows the highest pollutant concentrations such as 686mg/L for BOD5 and at 630mg/L CODMn. The pollutant as based on fowls manure compost was highly washed-off by subsurface water at 32.4mm/hr rainfall intensity, however the concentration was largely decreased at 43.2mm/hr rainfall intensity. The summary of the results is that the highest wash-off concentrations value shows at 32.4mm/hr rainfall intensity for BOD5 and at 67.1mm/hr for T-N and T-P.Non-Point Pollutant, Fowls manure, Rainfall intensity, Non-point runoff rate"

The aims of the present study were comparing the health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) of patients with type I and type II narcolepy patients, and determining the factors that influence the HR-QOL in narcolepsy patients. Methods: All patients performed night polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). HR-QOL and the severity of subjective symptoms were evaluated using various questionnaires, including the Korean versions of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index-Korean version, the Korean version Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Korean version Beck Depression Inventory-2. Results: We enrolled 21 type I narcolepsy patients and 27 type II patients. Type I patients had short rapid eye movement (REM) latency on night PSG and more sleep onset REM periods on MSLT. The total score of HRQOL was worse in patients with type I narcolepsy than in the type II narcolepsy patients. There was association between the severities of excessive daytime sleepiness, depression and the degree of worsening of QOL. CSF hypocretin level had no correlation with the scores of HR-QOL. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that type I narcolepsy patients are sleepier, depressive, and have more burden on the HR-QOL.

The attachment, adhesion, and proliferation of these cells were evaluated after 4 hr, 24 hr and 7 day incubations. Both RAW 264.7 and MC3T3-E1 cells showed a time-dependant correlation between attachment and adhesion on the surface of the titanium discs. Both types of cells tended to have higher survival rate on these discs as the surface roughness increased. The percentage of adherent inflammatory RAW 264.7 cells was greater than MC3T3-E1 cells at 24 hr, but this was reversed at 7 days in culture. The morphology of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells at 24 hr, determined using a surface emission microscope (SEM), appeared flattened and spread out while inflammatory RAW 264.7 cells were predominantly spherical in shape. The adhesion of both cell types on the titanium discs was dependant on the levels of fibronectin adsorbed on the disc surface, indicating that serum constituents modulate the efficient adhesion of these cells. Our data indicate that the cellular response to the titanium surface is dependent on the types of cells, surface roughness and serum constituents."

Recently, mutations in the human hairless (HR)gene have been implicated in its pathogenesis. The identification of mutations in the HR gene is important for differentiating between APL and alopecia universalis (AU).
Objective: We compared the HR genes of patients with presumed AU who showed minimal or no response to treatment with the HR genes of healthy controls. Methods:The subjects were 11 patients with presumed AU who had not responded to treatments. Fifty healthy people were included as controls for molecular analysis. To screen for mutations, polymerase chain reaction was performed.
Results: DNA analysis identified a novel heterozygous G-to-A transition at nucleotide position 191 in exon 5. The mutation was not found in the controls, other AU patients, or any unaffected family members except for the patients’mother and maternal grandfather, who were heterozygous HR gene carriers.

Conidia of B. dothidea were allowed to germinate on apple fruits under wetting condition at 25oC for 5 hr. They were air-dried for 0, 1, 2 or 4 hr, and then rewetted at 25oC for 5 hr. Following an initial wetness period of 5 hr, 83% of the conidia germinated.
The percent conidial germination increased to 96% when wetting was extended continuously another 5 hr.
However, no further conidial germination was observed when wetting was interrupted by dry periods of 1, 2 and 4 hr, resulting in 83, 81 and 82%, respectively.
The mean length of the germ tubes was 37 μm after 5 hr of wetting and elongated to 157 μm after 10 hr of continuous wetting. On the other hand, interruption of wetting by a dry period of 1 hr or longer after the 5 hr of initial wetting arrested the germ tube elongation at approximately 42 μm long. Prolonged rewetting up to 40 hr did not restore germ tube elongation on slide glasses under substrate treatments. Model simulation using weather data sets revealed that ending infection periods by a dry period of at least 1 hr decreased the daily infection periods, avoiding the overestimation of infection warning. This information can be incorporated into infection models for scheduling fungicide sprays to control apple white rot with fewer fungicide applications."

Chinese NOx and VOC emissions in MICS-Asia 2010 were 60% higher and 100% lower than those in INTEX-B 2006 during the simulation period. It makes the ratio of Chinese VOC to NOx emissions in INTEX-B 2006 (Case 1) is 3.2 times higher than that in MICS-Asia 2010 (Case 2). When the observed period mean 1-hr ozone concentration averaged across 106 air monitoring sites in the SMA (Seoul Metropolitan Area) was 37.6 ppb, the modeled values were similar to each other; 37.3 ppb for Case 1, and 40.4 ppb for Case 2. Both cases show that daily maximum 1-hr ZOC (Zero-Out Contribution) of Chinese NOx and VOC emissions were as high as 55 ppb and 35 ppb for the episode respectively. Correlation coefficients between ZOC of Chinese NOx and VOC emissions and the SMA daily maximum 1-hr ozone were 0.49~0.69. It indicates that Chinese emissions occasionally affect the SMA daily ozone peaks. On the other hand, Case 2 predicted 7 ppb and 1 ppb higher ZOC of Chinese NOx and VOC emissions than Case 1, when simulated ozone in the SMA is over 80 ppb. It implies that upwind NOx emissions would be more important than upwind VOC emissions for the long-range transport of ozone in Northeast Asia."

Methods: The medical records of patients who visited Severance Hospital for corneal refractive surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Keratometric data of patients who underwent evaluations using the Pentacam HR (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany), ORBscan II (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY, USA), and Topolyzer Vario instruments on the same day were obtained. Flat keratometry (Kf), steep keratometry (Ks), mean keratometry (Km), astigmatism keratometry (Kastig), Cartesian astigmatism (J0), and oblique astigmatism (J45) values were calculated. The measurement values of the three devices were subjected to Pearson’s correlation analysis and repeated measures analysis of variance (with Bonferroni correction); a Bland-Altman plot was also created.
Results: The keratometric data of 80 eyes were included in the analysis and all of the keratometric measurements obtained by the three devices showed significant correlations, i.e., good agreement. The Kf and Km measurements of the Pentacam HR were flatter than those of the ORBscan II, and the Kf, Km, Ks, and J45 measurements were flatter than those of the Topolyzer Vario.
However, there was no significant difference in keratometric values between the ORBscan II and Topolyzer Vario. Furthermore, the difference in corneal refractive power between the Pentacam HR and Topolyzer Vario was not clinically significant.
Conclusions: When measuring the corneal refractive power of patients without any history of corneal disorder or ocular surgery, the Topolyzer Vario is a clinically reliable device that shows similar performance to the ORBscan II and Pentacam HR."

TN의 경우 HRT 6 hr의 조건에서 25 와 16.2 에서 DEPHANOX 공정은 각각 53.9, 59.4%의 제거효율을 보였으며 M-DEPHANOX 공정의 경우 65.1, 64.4%의 제거효율을 보여 M-DEPHANOX 공정이 DEPHANOX 공정보다 효율이 더 좋은 것으로 나타났다. HRT 변화에 따른 암모니아성 질소 제거 효율은 HRT 5 hr까지 DEPHANOX, M-DEPHANOX 모두 90% 이상의 제거 효율을 보였으나 HRT 4, 3.5 hr에서 DEPHANOX의 경우 각각 43.8, 44.9%, M-DEPHANOX의 경우 각각 65.7, 47.7%로 나타나 M-DEPHANOX 공정이 HRT 변화에 더 강한 것으로 나타났다. TN 제거율은 HRT 6, 5, 4, 3,5 hr(온도; 16.2, 17.1, 16.5, 18 ) 조건에서 DEPHANOX 공정은 각각 59.4, 63.7, 32.9, 26.6%를 보인 반면 M-DEPHANOX 공정의 경우 각각 64.4, 67.5, 53.5, 36.6%의 제거효율을 보여 M-DEPHANOX 공정이 TN 제거효율면에서 우수한 것으로 나타났다. 온도 및 HRT 영향에서 M-DEPHANOX 공정이 DEPHANOX 공정보다 TN 제거 효율이 좋은 이유는 M-DEPHANOX 공정의 재포기조를 분할하여 간헐포기 과정을 둠으로써 탈질 효율이 향상되었기 때문이다.This study was initiated to evaluate the efficiency of M-DEPHANOX process which was designed to improve the performance of DEPHANOX process in municipal wastewater treatment. M-DEPHANOX characterizes to divide reaeration reactor of DEPHANOX into intermittent reactor and reaeration reactor, respectively. At HRT 6hr, effect of temperature showed that both processes have removal efficiencies of NH4-N over 91%, even though temperature droped from 25 to 16.2 . At temperature condition of 25 and 16.2 , DEPHANOX showed TN removal efficiencies of 53.9% and 59.4% and M-DEPHANOX did those of 65.1%, 64.4%, respectively. In NH4-N removal efficiency according to the HRT, both processes showed high removal efficiency over 90% at HRT 6hr(16.2 ) and HRT 5 hr(17.1 ), but, at decreased HRT(HRT 4hr, HRT 3.5 hr), DEPHANOX showed removal efficiencies of 43.8% and 44.9% and M-DEPHANOX did those of 65.7% and 47.7%, respectively. So, it was concluded that M-DEPHANOX is more strong in HRT variation than DEPHANOX. In addition, it was revealed that M-DEPHANOX was more better process in TN removal than DEPHANOX by showing that, at HRT 6, 5, 4, 3.5 hr(16.2, 17.1, 16.5 and 18 ), DEPHANOX had TN removal efficiencies of 59.4, 63.7, 32.9 and 26.6%, respectively, and M-DEPHANOX had those of 64.4, 67.5, 53.5, 36.6%, respectively. The reason why that M-DEPHANOX was more better than DEPHANOX in TN removal results from more better denitrification efficiency on M-DEPHANOX than that on DEPHANOX by dividing reaeration reactor of DEPHANOX into intermittent reactor and reaeration reactor.Municipal wastewater, Temperature, HRT, DEPHANOX, M-DEPHANOX"

After 6 hr of pork meat to meat fat contact,the adherence rates for ST and WT were approximately 4.21 and 26.87%, respectively, and after 6 hrs of pork meat tored meat contact they were 16.40 and 27.48%, respectively. However, after 24 hr of both types of contact, ST and WTshowed 100% adherence rates. The adherence rates for ST after 2 hr and 6 hr of pork meat to conveyer belt contact were1.34 and 0.60%, respectively, while the adherence rate for WT was 5.14% after 6 hr of contact. After pork meat tostainless steel contact, ST showed adherence rates of zero and 1.59% after 6 and 24 hr of contact, respectively, while theafter 6 hr. On the other hand, neither ST nor WT offeredadherence data following pork meat to cutting board contact. These results suggest that the adherence rates of ST and WTafter pork meat to pork meat contact or pork meat to processing surface contact were significantly affected by the contacttime and WT presented much higher adherence rates for both types of transmission than ST."

As a result, 24 hours after the patient was treated with 100 mCi high-dose iodine, the dose rate was attenuated to 1,035μSv/hr at the navel, to 109μSv/hr at 50 cm, and to 33μSv/hr at 100 cm. 24 hours after the patient was treated with 150 mCi high-dose iodine, the dose rate was attenuated to 637μSv/hr at the navel, to 100μSv/hr at 50 cm, and to 40μSv/hr at 100 cm. 24 hours after the patient was treated with 180 mCi high-dose iodine, the dose rate was attenuated to 1,251μSv/hr at the navel, 140μSv/hr at 50 cm, and to 56μSv/hr at 100 cm. In light of the current criterion for discharge recommended by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission being 70.4μSv/hr, the present study indicates earlier discharge is feasible by applying a new scheme. This suggests that the proposed scheme in this study will help to solve the problem of shortage of treatment beds with the increasing trend of patients with thyroid cancer taken into consideration.Radioiodine, High-Dose, Thyroid cancer, Radiation therapy"

The cycling time in four SBRs was adjusted to 12 hours and then included different aerobic times as 1 hr, 2.5 hr, 4 hr and 5.5 hr, respectively. Four SBR systems have been operated and investigated for over 40 days. As the increase of aeration time, the consumption of glycogen within sludge at the 1st non-aeration time a little bit was increased and the production of glycogen at the aeration time was increased. Also, the produced PHB amounts and PHB production rate at the 1st non-aeration time were increased as the decrease of aeration time, which showed the activation of the phosphorus removal. The ratios of nitrifying microorganisms' number and GAOs to the total microorganisms' number in SBRs was decreased as the decrease of the aeration time, however, the PAOs ratio was almost constant irrespective of the variation of aeration time."
507,Effect of an L- and T-Type Calcium Channel Blocker on 24-Hour Systolic Blood Pressure and Heart Rate in Hypertensive Patients,Masae Komukai,2012,대한심장학회,"Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an L- and T-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) on 24-hour systolic blood pressure (24-hour SBP) and heart rate (24-hour HR) profiles in essential hypertensive patients.
Subjects and Methods: Thirty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. The 24-hour SBP and HR were recorded before and after treatment with efonidipine (L- and T-type CCB, 40 mg), after waking. Changes in 24-hour SBP and HR and the diurnal to nocturnal SBP ratio were measured. The best-fit curves of changes in SBP and HR were depicted using a periodic function.
Results: The mean 24-hour SBP and HR decreased significantly after treatment. The diurnal to nocturnal SBP ratio in dipper-type hypertension cases decreased from 16.7±6.1% to 8.3±9.8% (p<0.05), whereas in non-dipper hypertension cases, it increased from 2.3±2.9%to 7.7±5.1% (p<0.01). The antihypertensive effect was minimal at 5.0 hours after drug administration and it slowly recovered at a constant rate (2.1 mm Hg/h) over 12 hours in dipper cases. The median 24-hour changes in HR in the dipper and non-dipper cases were -2.3/min and -5.4/min, respectively. A continuous reduction in the change in HR was seen from 3.5 to 23 hours after drug administration.
Conclusion: The antihypertensive action of efonidipine was characterized by a slow recovery of the SBP decrease at a constant rate (2.1mm Hg/h) and a non-administration time dependent reduction in 24-hour HR."

The jujube paste was made by heating for 3, 6, and 9　hours (hr) using a pressure cooker. The reducing sugar in the yakju sample drastically decreased within the first five day, and then gradually decreased in the order of the control yakju > yakju added with jujube paste heated for 3 hr > 6 hr > 9 hr on the 15th day. The total acid content gradually increased during the fermentation time. The pH of the yakju sample greatly decreased up until the 2nd day; then it slightly increased thereafter. Alcohol content showed drastic increase during the first five days, then gradually increased on the 15th day in the order of control yakju (16%), yakju added with jujube paste for 3 hr (14.7%), 6 hr (14%), and 9 hr (12.5%). The L value decreased with fermentation time in the order of control yakju > yakju added with jujube paste heated for 3 hr > 6 hr and 9 hr. Although the value of yakju added with jujube paste heated for 6 hr and 9 hr gradually decreased, the value of yakju added with jujube paste heated for 3 hr gradually increased. The b value greatly decreased from the 5th day until the 10th day, in the order of yakju added with jujube paste heated for 9 hr > 6 hr > 3 hr; the value showed almost no change thereafter. The a and b values of control yakju did not show a great change during the fermentation time.

Based on these results, addition of jujube paste heated for 6 hr appears to be the optimal condition for making yakju added with jujube paste."
510,Methylated-UHRF1 and PARP1 Interaction Is Critical for Homologous Recombination,함자영 /Ja Young Hahm,2020,생화학분자생물학회,"A recent study suggested that methylation of ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domain 1 (UHRF1) is regulated by SET7 and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1) and is essential for homologous recombination (HR). The study demonstrated that SET7-mediated methylation of UHRF1 promotes polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), inducing HR. However, studies on mediators that interact with and recruit UHRF1 to damaged lesions are needed to elucidate the mechanism of UHRF1 methylationinduced HR. Here, we identified that poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) interacts with damage-induced methylated UHRF1 specifically and mediates UHRF1 to induce HR progression. Furthermore, cooperation of UHRF1-PARP1 is essential for cell viability, suggesting the importance of the interaction of UHRF1-PARP1 for damage tolerance in response to damage. Our data revealed that PARP1 mediates the HR mechanism, which is regulated by UHRF1 methylation. The data also indicated the significant role of PARP1 as a mediator of UHRF1 methylation-correlated HR pathway."

Marine rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis and benthic copepod, Tigriopus japonicus were designated as standard test species with the endpoints of 24hr neonate mortality (24hr LC50) and 48hr population growth (48hr EC50) for rotifer, and 48hr nauplius mortality (48hr LC50) for benthic copepod. Tests method was referred to those of ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) with the replacement of test species which are widely distributed in Korean waters. The two species showed a wide tolerance on salinity (5~35 psu) and can be easily cultured in small space even they were not as sensitive as in the mortality test using the nauplius of marine invertebrates. However, these species revealed the significant ""concentration-response relationship"" tested with ocean disposal wastes, and reproducibility using cadmium as standard reference material between laboratories. Accordingly, these two species have good potential as test species for marine ecotoxicological test species. Also, we strongly recommend that at least one of these species be included in the test species of ""battery test"" in marine bioassay."

Forty-seven collegiate students (24 males and 23 females) walked or ran on a treadmill at three intensities, i.e., 4.8 km/hr, 6.4 km/hr, and 9.7 km/hr, for six minutes for each intensity with connection to Vmax229, a kind of gas analyzer, as well as wearing Lifecorder and the activity monitor on their waist. Energy expenditure measured or predicted by the three instruments were compared. Main results of the study were as follows: 1) Energy expenditure in the activity monitor at 4.8 and 6.4 km/hr showed significantly lower than Vmax229, energy expenditure in Lifecorder at 4.8km/hr showed significantly higher than Vmax229. 2) There was significant positive correlation in energy expenditure among three instruments. Especially, the activity monitor showed higher correlation with Vmax229 than the correlation Lifecorder showed with Vmax229. It was concluded that the validity of the activity monitor was high enough to use. Research investigating the validity of the activity monitor including more various modes of exercise, intensities, and subjects of other ages and fitness levels would be warranted."

Experimental rats were divided into four groups, which were composed of normal diet group (N group), high cholesterol diet group (HF group), high cholesterol and 5% Rosa multiflora diet group (HR group), and high cholesterol and Rosa multiflora complex diet group (HRC group). Rosa multiflora complex is composed of Duchesnea chrysantha, Salvia plebeia R. BR., and Sasa borealis.
The serum triglyceride (TG) content of the HF group was significantly higher than that of the N group, whereas that of the HRC group was significantly lower. Serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol contents of the HR and HRC groups were significantly higher than that of the HF group. The serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein- cholesterol contents of the HF group were significantly higher than those of the N group, and especially the atherogenic index of the HRC group was significantly reduced compared to the HF group. The liver TG and total cholesterol contents of the HF group were significantly increased compared to the normal diet group, while those of the HR and HRC groups were significantly decreased compared to the HF group. Fecal total lipid and total cholesterol contents of the HR and HRC groups were significantly increased compared to the HF group. Uridine 5'-diphospho (UDP)-glucuronyl transferase activity of the HR and HRC groups were increased compared to the HF group. Total bile acid contents of the HR and HRC groups were increased compared to the HF group, and that of the HRC group was significantly increased compared to the HF groups.

516,"The Impact of Air Pollution, Including Asian Sand Dust, on Respiratory Symptoms and Health-related Quality of Life in Outpatients With Chronic Respiratory Disease in Korea: A Panel Study",Motoyuki Nakao,2018,대한예방의학회,"Objectives: Air pollution is a growing concern in Korea because of transboundary air pollution from mainland China. A panel study was conducted to clarify the effects of air pollution on respiratory symptoms and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in outpatients with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Korea.
Methods: Patients filled out a questionnaire including self-reported HR-QoL in February and were followed up in May and July. The study was conducted from 2013 to 2015, with different participants each year. Air quality parameters were applied in a generalized estimating equation as independent variables to predict factors affecting HR-QoL.
Results: Lower physical fitness scores were associated with Asian sand dust events. Daily activity scores were worse when there were high concentrations of particulate matter (PM) less than 10 μm in diameter (PM10). Lower social functioning scores were associated with high PM less than 2.5 μm in diameter and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations. High NO2 concentrations also showed a significant association with mental health scores. Weather-related cough was prevalent when PM10, NO2, or ozone (O3) concentrations were high, regardless of COPD severity. High PM10 concentrations were associated with worsened wheezing, particularly in COPD patients.
Conclusions: The results suggest that PM, NO2, and O3 cause respiratory symptoms leading to HR-QoL deterioration. While some adverse effects of air pollution appeared to occur regardless of COPD, others occurred more often and more intensely in COPD patients. The public sector, therefore, needs to consider tailoring air pollution countermeasures to people with different conditions to minimize adverse health effects."

Rats were subjected to hepatic ischemia for60 min and were sacrificed at 3, 6, 12, 24 hr after reperfusion. Estrogen (4 mg/kg) or oil was administeredat 1 hr before hepatic ischemia. Alanine aminotransferase and asparatate aminotransferase levels wereimmediately increased after reperfusion, peaked at 6 hr and then declined gradually. Alanineaminotransferase and asparatate aminotransferase levels were significantly suppressed by estrogentreatment. After 24 hr of reperfusion, ischemic lobe showed inflammatory lesions with severe congestionin oil-treated group. However, in estrogen-treated group, only mild congestion was observed. Inhistological observation, severity of hepatic injury was getting worse in process of time. In oil-treatedanimals, most ischemic liver lobes showed hepatocyte necrosis and massive neutrophils infiltration.
However, estrogen attenuated the damage of hepatic tissue caused by hepatic ischemic and reperfusioninjury. Thus, our results suggest that estrogen play a potent protective role against hepatic injury"

Data were collected through internal documents, archival records, physical artifacts, and in-depth interviews. We analyzed POSCO's HR practices both in the individual practice level and human resource system level. Selection focusing on organizational fit, job security, long-term human resource development, operation of HR practices based on fairness, and employee benefit systems realizing lifetime employment were delineated and described as major human resource practices of POSCO. These human resource practices had been driven by the four guiding principles, such as respect for people, a sense of mission, lifetime employment, and promotions from within. Further, we analyzed and evaluated POSCO's human resource management system from the perspective of strategic human resource management. Results showed that POSCO's HR system had very high internal consistency among HR practices in terms of single-employee consistency, among-employee consistency, and temporal consistency. For the period of Park's tenure as CEO, POSCO's HR system represented characteristics of both relationship-oriented and high-utilization HR system. We concluded that POSCO's phenomenal success during Park's tenure was in part influenced by its unique and consistent human resource policies and practices, which created employee commitment and built a bond of loyalty between employee and the organization.human resource management, guiding principle, POSCO, Taejoon Park"
519,The role of schools' perceived human resource policies in teachers' professional development activities: a comparative study of innovations toward competence-based education,Audrey Seezink,2011,서울대학교 교육연구소,"The change toward competence-based education has implications for teachers as well as school management. This study investigates which professional development activities teachers undertake related to this change and how these activities differ among schools with various human resource (HR) policies. Two types of HR policy were involved: (1) a government-enforced, national system of Integrated Personnel Management and (2) a voluntary, integrative approach of Schooling of teachers, Organizational development of schools and teacher training institutes, Action- and development-oriented research, and Professional development of teachers. Semi-structured interviews with 30 teachers in nine schools with different HR policies were held and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings show that teachers undertake professional development activities in five categories: maintaining knowledge base, applying and experimenting, reflection, collaboration, and activities indirectly related to teaching practice. Teachers' professional development activities were found to be relatively similar across schools with different HR policies. It is concluded that neither government-enforced nor voluntary HR policies seem to play much of a role in the participation by teachers in professional development activities. Implications for further research and school practice are discussed."

As a result, it had no difference of organic matter removal, however, HRT 6hr is the best of three conditions in the removal of nutrients. In particular, the nitrification rate presented the same degree in three conditions, however, as NO_3^--N concentration of permeate in HRT 6hr was 1.5mg/L, the denitrification rate of HRT 6hr was the highest. Likewise, the phosphorus presented the highest removal efficiency in HRT 6hr too. it was due to the highest supply of carbon source in the influent and the highest maintenance of MLSS concentration in the reactor.Membrane, Intermittently aerated membrane bioreactor, HRT, Nitrification/denitrification, Nitrogen mass balance"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats(n = 49) were randomly assigned to the time course of the treadmill running (VO₂max 75-80%, 1hr). Muscle samples were obtained before and recovery period of the exercise (immediately, 30 min, 1hr, 2hr, 3hr and 6hr from the running) at the soleus muscle for the determination of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p70S6 kinase (p70S6k), eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1) and AMPK phosphorylation. Endurance exercise generated a significant increase in mTOR phosphorylation immediately after exercise and the phosphorylation maintained up to 6hr of recovery (∼90%, p=.024). In addition, 4EBP1 phosphorylation was significantly increased at the immediately after exercise and decreased up to an hour recovery. However, 4EBP1 was resumed to increase for 2-3hrs during recovery (∼48%, p=.05). However, Phosphorylation of p70S6K was elevated above rest level throughout the 6hrs recovery and reached peak at 6hr recovery (303%, p=.001). On the other hand, Phospho-AMPK (Thr172) was increased from 30min to 3hr of recovery (p<.05). These results clearly demonstrate that intensitive endurance running result in significant differences in protein signaling of muscle protein synthesis."
522,Effect of 4-hexylresorcinol on Blood Coagulation and Healing of Injured Vessel in a Rat Model,박용태,2013,대한악안면성형재건외과학회,"Purpose: For reconstruction of craniomaxillofacial defects caused by tumor, trauma, infection etc, free flap transplantation with microvascular surgery is a very useful method. Thrombus formation at the anastomosis site is the major cause of graft failure. 4-Hexylresorcinol (4-HR) is generally known as an antiseptic and antiparasitic agent. This study was conducted in order to evaluate the effect of 4-HR on blood coagulation in vitro. In addition, we investigated thrombus formation and endothelial repair of an injured vessel in an animal model.
Methods: In the in vitro experiment, we compared blood coagulation time between the 4-HR treated group and normal blood. Thirty rats were used for in vivo animal experiments. After exposure of the right femoral vein, a micro vessel clamp was placed and the femoral vein was intentionally cut. Microvascular anastomosis was performed on all rats using 10-0 nylon under microscopy. The animals were divided into two groups. In the experimental group (n=15), 4-HR (250 mg/kg) mixed with olive oil (10 mL/kg) was administered per os daily. Animals in the control group (n=15) were given olive oil only.
The animals were sacrificed at three days, seven days, and fourteen days after surgery and rat femoral vein samples were taken. Vascular patency and thrombus formation were investigated just before sacrifice. Histologic analysis was performed under a microscope.
Results: Results of an in vitro blood coagulation test showed that coagulation time was delayed in the 4-HR treated group.
The results obtained from an in vivo 4-HR administered rat model showed that the patency of all experimental groups was better at thirty minutes, seven days, and fourteen days after microvascular anastomosis than that of the control group at seven and fourteen days after anastomosis, and the amount of thrombus in the experimental groups was much less than that of the control group. Endothelial repair was observed in the histologic analysis.
Conclusion: Findings of this study demonstrated that blood coagulation was delayed in the vitro 4-HR treated group. In addition, good vascular patency, anti-thrombotic effect, and repair of venous endothelial cells were observed in the vivo 4-HR administered rat group."

Exercise Science, 13(3): 289-300, 2004. Cardiorespiratory responses to the types and speeds of walking in seven male collegiate students were observed. Treadmill walking in forward(FW), backward(BW), and lateral(LW) directions were performed at normal and fast speed which were selected by each subject during the pretest period. VO2 and HR were measured at pre-exercise and every min during the 5 minutes of exercise . BP was measured at pre- exercise and 5 minutes after exercise. The two way repeated measures ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was accepted at the p<.05 level. In case of normal walking, the fasttest walking is FW and LW is slowest. In case of brisk walking, FW is fasttest. LW is faster than BW. The responses of VO2, HR, and BP are not significantly different among 3 walking types, but the VO2s and HRs during BW and LW are increased more significantly than those during FW. The systolic BPs during BW and LW are increased more sharply than those during FW ; that during LW is increased more sharply than that during BW in case of normal walking. The systolic blood pressures during LW and BW are increased more sharply than those during FW in case of brisk walking. The results of this study suggest that LW and BW could also be considered as one of effective ways to develope the cardiorespiratory exercise program and the rehabilitation program for the lower limbs.Walking, Cardiorespiratory response, Exercise prescription"

Purpose: To compare energy expenditure, correlation and exercise intensity measured by accelerometer and heart rate (HR) monitor during different exercises. Methods: This is a comparison study testing convergent validity between accelerometer and HR-monitor. A total of 26 participants (15 women) with a mean age of 21.8±2.4 years were included. The ActiGraph GT3X with 60 s epoch length was used to measure the participants’ accelerometer counts. HR was measured using Polar team 2 HR belts during 4x4 min running (four intervals lasting four minutes), 4x4 min spinning and Zumba. Results: Pearson correlation coefficient between mean % HR max and accelerometer counts was 0.69 in Zumba, 0.14 in 4x4 spinning and -0.42 in 4x4 running. Estimated energy expenditure from accelerometer was 2.25±1.69 kcal/min lower, i.e. 18.6 %, than energy expenditure estimated from HR monitor during 4x4 running. The corresponding numbers for 4x4 spinning and Zumba were 6.27±2.18 kcal/min lower, i.e. 55.7% and 2.64±1.78 kcal/min lower, i.e. 23.6%, respectively. A Bland-Altman plot shows that this difference increases with higher activity level in Zumba. For 4x4 min running the HR-monitor and accelerometer classified 76% and 60%, respectively, of the participants’ activity as vigorous intensity. Conclusion: A large instrumental variation in energy estimation across activities was found. Energy expenditure estimated by accelerometer was around 20% lower for 4x4 running and Zumba, and around 50% lower for 4x4 spinning, compared to energy expenditure estimated from HR monitor. The large variation in the correlation coefficients reflects the methodical differences explained in the paper."

As results, ABPI, baPWV and AIx, that were arterial stiffness variables, were tend to decrease at immediately after aerobic and resistance exercise, but these variables were recovered and increased than the resting values during recovery 1hr and 2hr. The patterns of STI, LVET and PEP/LVET, that were left cardiac contractility variables, were similar with those of arterial stiffness variables during recovery periods after aerobic and resistance exercise. In conclusion, the arterial stiffness was decreased at immediately after aerobic and resistance exercise, but they were increased during recovery. These changes of arterial stiffness variables seemed to be independent with left cardiac contractility variables."

Thus, this study firstly conducted to extract which HR practices were associated with the act and evaluated the relationship between the HR practices and organisational effectiveness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine how employees perceived the HR practices which are based on the tourism promotion act and how they impacted the organisational effectiveness by utilising the structural equation modeling approach. This study has demonstrated that ‘training and job security’ had a positive influence on ‘distributive’ and ‘procedure justice’ while ‘selection’ did not significantly influence both ‘distributive’ and ‘procedure justice’. This study found that the tourism promotion act was a predominantly influential factor in the aspect of training and job security which implied that deluxe hotels were driven by best practice as set out in the legislation in relation to training and job security HR practice. This study will help gain a better understanding of how to assign a hotel rating using specified criteria as a fundamental material and why foreign managers and investors have to pay attention this to keep a high level of hotel quality as a deluxe hotel."
534,The Effect of Breathing Cycles Program on Heart Rate and Sleep Parameters in Healthy Young Adults,Wattanapanyawech Jirawat,2020,대한수면학회,"Background and ObjectiveaaIn recent years, sleep problems have been increasing globally, there exists an urgent need to develop a therapeutic program promoting sleep quality. This study investigated the effect of three types of deep breathing cycles programs on heart rate (HR) and sleep parameters in healthy young adults.
MethodsaaThirty healthy participants were recruited. HR and sleep parameters were measured via a smartwatch in all participants for two consecutive days. Participants were randomized into the forced deep breathing cycles (FDBC), non-forced deep breathing cycles (N-FDBC) and breathing control (BC) groups, with each participant performing the breathing cycle programs before sleep latency for 30 minutes.
ResultsaaN-FDBC showed a significant increase in sleep quality (p < 0.001), time in bed (p < 0.05), and total sleep time (p < 0.001), as well as a significant decrease in sleep latency and %awake during sleep (p < 0.001). During sleep, maximum HR, minimum HR, average awake HR during sleep, average light sleep HR, and average deep sleep HR were significantly lower (p < 0.01). For the FDBC group, significant increases in sleep latency (p < 0.05) and decreases in %awake during sleep (p < 0.05) were observed. HR before sleep was higher (p < 0.01). Average HR while awake during sleep and light sleep stages significantly decreased (p < 0.001). Such changes in all parameters were not observed after the BC group.
ConclusionsaaOur study demonstrates that N-FDBC yields clinical benefits by improving sleep quality and HR response during sleep in healthy adults."
535,Cyst Fluid Carcinoembryonic Antigen Level Difference between Mucinous Cystic Neoplasms and Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms,Ibrahim Hakkı Köker,2021,대한소화기내시경학회,"Background/Aims: The role of cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level in differentiating mucinous pancreatic cystic lesions(PCLs) is controversial. We investigated the role of cyst fluid CEA in differentiating low-risk (LR)-intraductal papillary mucinousneoplasms (IPMNs) from high-risk (HR)-IPMNs and LR-mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs).
Methods: This was a retrospective study of 466 patients with PCLs who underwent endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needleaspirationover a 7-year period. On histology, low-grade dysplasia and intermediate-grade dysplasia were considered LR, whereashigh-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma were considered HR.
Results: Data on cyst fluid CEA levels were available for 50/102 mucinous PCLs with definitive diagnoses. The median CEA (range)levels were significantly higher in HR cysts than in LR cysts (2,624 [0.5–266,510] ng/mL vs. 100 [16.8–53,445] ng/mL, p=0.0012).
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.930 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5–0.8; p<0.001) fordifferentiating LR-IPMNs from LR-MCNs. The AUROC was 0.921 (95% CI, 0.823–1.000; p<0.001) for differentiating LR-IPMNsfrom HR-IPMNs. Both had a CEA cutoff level of >100 ng/mL, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%.
Conclusions: Cyst fluid CEA levels significantly vary between LR-IPMNs, LR-MCNs, and HR-IPMNs. A CEA cutoff level of>100 ng/mL had a 100% NPV in differentiating LR-IPMNs from LR-MCNs and HR-IPMNs."

538,Clinicopathological features and post-resection outcomes of inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver,Kibong Oh,2021,한국간담췌외과학회,"Backgrounds/Aims: Hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor (HIPT) is a rare disease characterized by chronic infiltration of inflammatory cells and area of fibrosis. The objective of this retrospective observational study was to investigate clinicopathological features and outcomes of patients who underwent hepatic resection (HR) for HIPT. Methods: From 2009 to 2018, seven patients with HIPT underwent HR, accounting for 0.06% of 11,979 adults who underwent HR at our center. Results: These seven patients included five men and two women. Their mean age was 62.3±11.6 years.
In four patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis, liver masses were suspected of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or combined HCC-cholangiocarcinoma based on imaging studies. In three patients without HBV infection, two patients were suspected of HCC, for whom liver biopsy was not performed. One patient was suspected of liver abscess or HIPT, for whom percutaneous liver biopsy was performed and the mass was diagnosed with HIPT. However, this patient underwent HR owing to abdominal pain. No patient presented with abnormally elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II, or CA19-9. During a mean follow-up period of 76.4±34.8 months, no patient experienced recurrence of HIPT. Conclusions: HIPT, a rare form of liver disease, is often misdiagnosed as malignant liver tumor. Active histological diagnosis is warranted for patients with suspected HIPT to avoid unnecessary operation. HR can be indicated in case of diagnostic ambiguity of HIPT or under a clinical diagnosis of malignant liver tumor..."

Extracting 300g of below 0.5cm size dried sample in 7.5L of water or 30～95% ethanol for 9 hr at 100℃ were carried out. pH during extraction was between 4.0 and 6.5. Color b-value of extracts was increased according to lower ethanol concentration and longer extraction time. Color a-value and b-value was increased more in stem than in root. Extracts were increased rapidly within 2～3 hr. The extract in 30～70% ethanol was 0.84～1.34%(w/v) with root. Main free sugar of extracts was sucrose in root. The eleutherosides were extracted rapidly within 3hr, moreover were increased in water or 30～70% ethanol more than 95% ethanol concentration. Extraction of acanthoic acid from root was more affected on ethanol concentration than extracted time, moreover it was detected only trace by extracting with water. Furthermore, acanthoic acid was extracted rapidly within 2hr in 50～70% ethanol, and was extracted 3 times higher with 70% ethanol than with 30% ethanol. The content of acanthoic acid in residue after extraction was affected largely by extraction solvents. The extraction efficiency in 70, 50 and 35% of ethanol concentration was about 95, 90 and 35%, respectively. The eleutherosides were extracted to 95% with water or mixture of water and ethanol. Therefore, the reflux extraction in 40～70% ethanol concentration for 3～5hr was adequate for extraction of functional materials from Acanthopanax koreanum."
540,돼지 미성숙 난포란의 체외성숙에 미치는 Thymidine처리 효과,민성훈 /Min Sung-Hun,2012,사단법인 한국동물생명공학회,"The objective of this study was to examine the effect of thymidine treatment during in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine follicular oocytes on blastocyst development. Porcine oocytes were treated with thymidine (10 mM, 20 mM and 30 mM) for 2 or 6 hr in the preiods of IVM I and/or II. The survival rates of the blastocysts in the 6 hr treatment groups of 10 mM and 20 mM during IVM I period were significantly higher than those of control group (p<0.05).
However, the survival rate of the blastocysts in the 2 hr treatment group of 20 mM during IVM II period was significantly higher than control group (p<0.05). Furthermore, the survival rate of the blastocysts in the 6 hr treatment group of 30 mM during IVM II period was significantly lower than control group (p<0.05). Consistent with the previous result, blastocyst development of both IVM I and II treatment group was also showed as similar pattern.
Total and apoptotic cell numbers of blastocysts derived from thymidine treated porcine oocytes were examined by using Tunel assay. The results showed that there was no significant differences in total cell number of blastocysts between thymidine treated and untreated groups. However, apoptosis-positive cells in the thymidine treated group (6 hr IVM I) were significantly lower than those of other groups (p<0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that high quality oocytes were selected by DNA synthesis mechanism according to high concentration thymidine treatment during porcine oocyte maturation. Therefore, we concluded that presumptive selected oocytes by thymidine treatment during maturation periods improved the further embryo development and embryonic quality of IVF embryos by decreasing the incidence of apoptosis in preimplantation porcine embryos."

544,Role of Ovarian Function Suppression in Premenopausal Women with Early Breast Cancer,박우찬 /Woo-Chan Park,2016,한국유방암학회,"Historically, endocrine therapy for breast cancer began with ovarian ablation (OA) for the treatment of premenopausal patients.
After the identification of estrogen receptors and the development of many antiestrogens, tamoxifen has been approved and used as the standard endocrine therapy for hormonal receptor (HR)-positive premenopausal patients to date. With the development of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists, the paradigm of endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with HR-positive breast cancer began to change from OA to ovarian function suppression (OFS). To date, the indication for OFS was limited to those premenopausal patients with HR-positive breast cancer who were unable to use tamoxifen as the primary adjuvant endocrine therapy. However, following the definitive demonstration of the therapeutic role of OFS added to tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor after chemotherapy in large randomized trials, such as Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial or Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial, the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for the use of endocrine therapy in premenopausal HR-positive breast cancer were recently updated to recommend OFS in high-risk patients who required adjuvant chemotherapy. In contrast, the role of OFS to protect ovarian function during chemotherapy in premenopausal women has remained controversial, and some evidence showing the protective effect of OFS on the ovaries during chemotherapy as well as its therapeutic effect for breast cancer in premenopausal women with HR-negative breast cancer was recently published. Further evaluation is necessary to determine its exact role. In conclusion, the role of OA or OFS has been evolving, not only to improve the efficacy of breast cancer treatment, but also to preserve ovary function. OFS remains a main strategy for premenopausal women with HR-positive early breast cancer, though its exact role should be determined in further studies."
545,Study of the effect of mechanical alloying on the structure of Ni-Mn-Sn Heusler alloy,S. V. Dhanal,2020,대한기계학회,"The formation process of nanocrystalline Ni-Mn-Sn Heusler alloy was investigated using mechanical alloying route. Powder samples of this alloy were fabricated using high milling energy technology of planetary ball mill in an argon atmosphere. The effects of selected milling time (0 hr, 5 hr, 10 hr and 15 hr) on the crystallite size, lattice strain, morphology and chemical composition of as-milled powder samples were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) attached with energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDX). Thermal behavior of the samples was analyzed by differential scanning caloorimetry (DSC). Results indicated that the formation of single phase Ni 2 MnSn Heusler alloy was obtained after 15 hr of milling through the balance between particle coalescence and fracture accompanied by uniform grain refinement. The optimum milling time resulted from the proper selection of milling parameters. Compositional analysis of 15 hr asmilled sample revealed stoichiometric Heusler composition (X 2 YZ) of Ni-Mn-Sn alloy with no impurities. The subsequent heating of the powder particles in DSC showed crystallization of NiMn-Sn alloy. The obtained results provide an understanding of the fabrication of Ni-Mn based Heusler alloy powders by mechanical alloying technique by using laboratory scale ball mill with the aim to bring out structural and thermal aspects of the alloy."

We aimed to investigate the associations between ADL trough levels (TLs) and MH, and between ADL TLs and histologic remission (HR) at 16 weeks from ADL treatment in pediatric CD patients.
Methods: This was a prospective study on moderate-to-severe luminal pediatric CD patients receiving ADL. Ileocolonoscopies and biopsies, as well as clinical activity assessments, laboratory examinations, including tests for ADL TLs and antibody to ADL, were performed 16 weeks after ADL initiation. MH was defined as a Simple Endoscopic Score for CD of 0. HR was defined as the complete absence of microscopic inflammation.
Results: Seventeen subjects (13 males, 4 females) were included. At 16 weeks from ADL initiation, 14 (82.4%), 8 (47.1%), and 4 (23.5%) patients achieved clinical remission, MH, and HR, respectively. ADL TLs were significantly higher in patients who achieved MH compared to those who did not (13.0 ± 6.5 vs. 6.2 ± 2.6 μg/mL, respectively; P = 0.023) and also significantly higher in patients who achieved HR compared to those who did not (17.9 ± 5.3 vs. 6.8 ± 2.5 μg/ mL, respectively; P = 0.02). The optimal TL for predicting MH was 8.76 μg/mL.
Conclusion: Serum ADL TLs at 16 weeks were significantly higher in pediatric patients with CD who achieved MH and HR, respectively. TDM may guide in optimizing treatment efficacy and better target MH in the era of treat-to-target."

550,Comparison of hemodynamic changes between phenylephrine and combined phenylephrine and glycopyrrolate groups after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery,Hea Jo Yoon,2012,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: Hypotension remains a common clinical problem of spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery and phenylephrine is used as a vasopressor to address this. However, phenylephrine reduces maternal cardiac output (CO) due to reflex bradycardia. Glycopyrrolate is safe for the fetus, and increases heart rate (HR). Using a noninvasive measure of CO, we compared maternal hemodynamic changes between the phenylephrine only group (group P) and the phenylephrine plus glycopyrrolate group (group PG).
Methods: In this randomized study, 60 women scheduled for elective cesarean delivery were allocated to group P (n = 30) or group PG (n = 30). In both groups, phenylephrine was infused at 50 μg/min. This infusions stopped if systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher than the baseline value, and phenylephrine 100 μg was injected if SBP was lower than 80% of the baseline value from spinal anesthesia to delivery. In group PG, glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg was injected intravenously after spinal anesthesia. Hemodynamic parameters, such as SBP, heart rate (HR), stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index (CI) were measured before and until 15 min after spinal anesthesia.
Results: There were no significant differences in SBP and SVI compared to the baseline value in each group and between the two groups. HR and CI reduced significantly from 8 min to 15 min in group P compared to the baseline value as well as group PG for each time-point. However, HR and CI were maintained in group PG.
Conclusions: The use of glycopyrrolate added to phenylephrine infusion to prevent hypotension by spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery was effective in maintaining HR and CI."

Vancomycin 1.0 g was administered intravenously over 1 hr every 12 hr. Three specimens were collected at 72 hr after the first dose from all patients at the following times, at 0.5 hr before regularly scheduled infusion, at 0.5 hr and 2 hr after the end of 1 hr infusion. Serum vancomycin levels were analyzed by fluorescence polarization immunoassay technique with TDX-FLX. The standard deviation (SD) of the assay over its working range had been determined at the serum vancomycin concentrations of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 120 μg/ml in quadruplicate. The polynomial equation of vancomycin assay error was found to be SD (μg/ml)=0.0224+0.0540C+0.00173C2 (R2=0.935). There were differences in the influence of weight with vancomycin assay error on pharmacokinetic parameters of vancomycin using the nonlinear least squares regression analysis but there were no differences on the Bayesian analysis. This polynomial equation can be used to improve the precision of fitting of pharmacokinetic models to optimize the process of model simulation both for population and for individualized pharmacokinetic models. The result suggests the improvement of dosage regimens for the better and safer care of patients receiving vancomycin."

Two nitrogen sources, ammonia and nitrate, showed different effects on specific growth rates (0.25 hr−1 and 0.12 hr−1, respectively), biomass yields (0.56 vs. 0.39) and specific toluene degradation rates (0.51 hr−1 vs. 0.26 hr−1). Under the resting cell conditions, the cells pre-cultured in the ammonia-containing medium showed higher specific toluene degradation rate than that in nitrate-containing medium (0.045 hr−1 vs. 0.038 hr−1). Ammonia as a nitrogen source was effective for degradation in high toluene concentration because high cellular biomass was accomplished. Nitrate showed slow growth rate compared to ammonia. The resting cell conditions demonstrated that it was able to degrade toluene efficiently without increasing biomass. These conditions could be a solution for degrading VOC after high cellular biomass was obtained in a biofilter. By changing the nitrogen source and the growth conditions according to the toluene concentration, the control of cell biomass and the desired removal capacity were accomplished."

I carried out SD in the water cage included multiple platforms. Repetitive SD executes for 36 days. I measured weight every week after SD for 6 weeks. To check emotional condition, I carried out intruder-evoked ag-gression test and modified forced swimming test. In the present results, group treated 24-hr rest and 48-hr rest after 24-hr SD showed lower natural aggressiveness and high depression. However, group treated 72-hr rest after 24-hr SD indicated emotional changes to recover the normal conditions. In the weight change, all group showed significant decrease compared to control for 6 weeks. I suggest that appropriate rest time after SD can help to restore emotional change."

The specimens were carried out the heat treatment for 0.5 hr, 1 hr, and 10 hrs atthree different temperatures (1473 K, 1573 K and 1673 K). In acidic solution, the hardness of the corroded AS10 specimen was similar to regardless of the temperature at 0.5 hr and 1 hr. The probability distribution of 10 hrs was decreased than asreceived specimen as temperature increase. The corroded AS15 specimen for 0.5 hr was similar except to the highest 1673K. The 1673 K-1hr and 10hrs specimens showed the lowest probability distribution, but others were similar. The probability distribution of the corroded AS20 specimens for 0.5 hr and 1hr were similar regardless of temperature. The probability distribution of 10h decreased as temperature increase. In alkaline solution, the hardness of the corroded AS10 specimen at 0.5 hr was similar to regardless of the temperature. The probability distribution of 1 hr and 10hrs had large dispersion as temperature increase. The corroded AS15 and AS20 specimen for 1 hr and 10hrs was smaller than the corroded as-received specimen. The compositions of Al2O3 ceramic were found to be corroded by acidic and alkaline solutions. The shape parameters and scale parameters of the Weibull statistical analysis can be used to predict the life of the alumina ceramics."

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of heat stress on blood parameters, blood proteins (haptoglobin [Hp]; heat shock protein 70 [HSP70]), rectal temperature (RT), heart rate (HR) and rumination time in Korean native beef calves.
Methods: Thirty-two Korean native beef calves were randomly assigned to 8 groups with 4 animals per group. They were kept in environmental condition with temperature-humidity index (THI) ranging from 70.01 to 87.72 in temperature-humidity controlled chamber for 7 days.
Results: Their HR, RT, and serum cortisol and HSP70 levels were increased (p<0.05) in high THI compared to those at low THI. But, serum Hp level was decreased (p<0.05) in high THI compared to these at low THI. In addition, HR, RT, serum cortisol and HSP70 were positively correlated with THI (R2 = 0.8368, p<0.01; R2 = 0.6162, p<0.01; R2 = 0.581, p<0.01; R2 = 0.2241, p = 0.0062, respectively). There was also positive association between HR and cortisol (R2 = 0.4697, p<0.01). Similarly, RT and cortisol were positively associated (R2 = 0.4581, p<0.01). But, THI and HR were negatively correlated with Hp (R2 = 0.2157, p = 0.02; R2 = 0.3362, p = 0.003). Hematology and metabolites results were different among treatment groups. Standing position was higher (p<0.05) in the high THI group compared to that in the low THI group.
Conclusion: Based on these results, it can be concluded that HR, RT, blood parameters (Cortisol, HSP70, Hp) and standing position are closely associated with heat stress. These parameters can be consolidated to develop THI chart for Korean native beef calves."
557,"Expression of Wee1 Gene in the Ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi Embryo",이원영 /Won Young Lee,2011,한국발생생물학회,"ABSTRACT : It is suggested that FGF/Ras/MEK signaling plays crucial roles in specification and cell division of the mesodermal precursor cells in ascidian embryos. To investigate how the number of cell division in tissue precursor cells is determined, we have characterized Wee1 homolog, Hr-Wee1 of the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi. We found that the Hr-Wee1 mRNA is expressed both maternally and zygotically. Maternal transcript is localized to the cytoplasm in the animal cells, while zygotic expression is seen in cells of the endoderm lineage from 32-cell to 110-cell stages. Zygotic in situ signal is detected in the A-line neural plate cells of neurulae, and in epidermal cells of the head region of tailbud embryos. Embryos treated with MEK signaling inhibitor showed a similar pattern to normal embryos in expression of Hr-Wee1. Therefore, it is likely that MEK signaling does not affect the maternal and zygotic expression of Hr-Wee1."

Creatinine clearance (CrCl) as a parameter to evaluate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the kidney can be measured using a 24 hour urine collection (24hr-CrCl) or estimated by several predictive formulas using serum creatinine (Scr). Since these all have their limitations, this study was performed to find a more accurate formula for estimating renal function in malignancy.
Patients with a malignancy who had their 24hr-CrCl done at Samsung Medical Center from January 2008 to May 2012 were reviewed retrospectively.
Four hundred and fifty one patients were evaluated: males were 268 and female 183, the median age was 52 years (range 20-82), and Scr was 1.0 mg/dL (range 0.26-7.51) and mean 24hr-CrCl 103.6 mL/min. The estimation of all formulas was not different from the 24hr-CrCl, with the exception of the Wright formula (p<0.001). The absolute Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) was less biased and more precise than the MDRD however, the proximate estimation of both formulas was limited to patients with a 24hr-CrCl of <50 mL/min (p=0.21, p=0.33). The Cockcroft-Gault (CG) estimation was the most accurate, and it was not different from the 24hr-CrCl over a broad range of renal function (bias 1.91, 2.45, -0.48% in 24hr-CrCl<50, 50-100, >100mL/min).
It is difficult to estimate the individual GFR over a broad range accurately with only one formula,however, these observations suggest that the CG provides a relatively good estimate of the 24hr-CrCl in general. Additionally, the use of the absolute MDRD can be considered in patients whose renal function has decreased, however, the Wright formula which significantly overestimated the 24hr-CrCl by 13.80%, showed limited applicability."

561,Nocturnal Urine Production in Women With Global Polyuria,Thomas F. Monaghan,2020,대한배뇨장애요실금학회,"Purpose: Low nocturnal urine production (NUP) may be sufficient to rule out global polyuria (GP) in men. This study determines the sensitivity of indices for nocturnal polyuria (NP), defined as nocturnal polyuria index (NPi; nocturnal urine volume/24-hour urine volume) ≥0.33 or NUP ≥90 mL/hr, for detecting GP in women.
Methods: Data were analyzed from 2 prospective protocols involving subjects recruited from a urology ambulatory care unit and a continence clinic. Women ≥18 years with nocturia were included if they met either of 2 common criteria for GP: (1) ≥40 mL/kg/24 hr or (2) ≥3,000 mL/24 hr.
Results: Thirty-one women were included (NPi, 28.6 [21.3–40.7]; NUP, 100.8 [68.3–135.8] mL/hr). At the ≥40 mL/kg/24-hr cutoff, 40% and 63% of women reporting ≥1 nocturnal void(s) (n=30) had NPi ≥0.33 and NUP ≥90 mL/hr, respectively.
Additionally, 53% and 71% of subjects reporting ≥2 nocturnal voids (n=17) had NPi ≥0.33 and NUP ≥90 mL/hr, respectively. At the ≥3,000 mL/24-hr cutoff, 38% and 69% of women reporting ≥1 nocturnal void(s) (n=13) had NPi ≥0.33 and NUP ≥90 mL/hr, respectively, and 63% and 88% of subjects reporting ≥2 nocturnal voids (n=8) had NPi ≥0.33 and NUP ≥90 mL/hr, respectively. By extension, 37%–62% of women with nocturia and GP did not have NP by NPi ≥0.33 criteria, and 12%–37% did not have NP by NUP ≥90 mL/hr criteria.
Conclusions: Indices of excess nighttime urination do not reliably predict GP in women. A full-length voiding diary may be particularly important in the evaluation of women with nocturia. Nocturia in women merits further consideration as a distinct entity."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of YYA on BP and HR in healthy men. Twenty-nine men took part in this study. The subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups: Ylang-Ylang group (YYG, n= 15) and control group (CG, n= 14). Physiological parameters recorded were BP by using a sphygmomanometer and HR by using an EKG. The present results demonstrated that inhalation of YYA significantly decreased the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Inhalation of YYA also significantly decreased the HRs in 10 leads, except in lead I and aVR. This indicates that the HRs recorded in lead I and aVR were less sensitive or obtuse compared to those in the 10 other leads. Therefore, such a result reveals that it is necessary to be aware of the terms regarding the position. In the present results, YYA caused a reduction of HR and BP, and a relief of the arousal level in healthy men. The present results show a sedative effect of YYA, and this study provides some evidences for the usage of YYA in medicinal agent."

564,Maintenance of genome integrity and active homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells,최의환 /Eui-Hwan Choi,2020,생화학분자생물학회,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) possess speciﬁc gene expression patterns that confer the ability to proliferate indeﬁnitely and enable pluripotency, which allows ESCs to differentiate into diverse cell types in response to developmental signals. Compared to differentiated cells, ESCs harbor an elevated level of homologous recombination (HR)-related proteins and exhibit exceptional cell cycle control, characterized by a high proliferation rate and a prolonged S phase. HR is involved in several aspects of chromosome maintenance. For instance, HR repairs impaired chromosomes and prevents the collapse of DNA replication forks during cell proliferation. Thus, HR is essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity and prevents cellular dysregulation and lethal events. In addition, abundant HR proteins in the prolonged S phase can efﬁciently protect ESCs from external damages and protect against genomic instability caused by DNA breaks, facilitating rapid and accurate DNA break repair following chromosome duplication. The maintenance of genome integrity is key to preserving the functions of ESCs and reducing the risks of cancer development, cell cycle arrest, and abnormal replication. Here, we review the fundamental links between the stem cell-speciﬁc HR process and DNA damage response as well as the different strategies employed by ESCs to maintain genomic integrity."

566,"Proteomic Changes in Chick Brain Proteome Post Treatment with Lathyrus Sativus Neurotoxin, β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-Diaminopropionic Acid (L-ODAP): A Better Insight to Transient Neurolathyrism",Anil Kumar D,2018,한국독성학회,"Neurolathyrism is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by spastic paraplegia resulting from the excessive consumption of Lathyrus sativus (Grass pea). β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (L-ODAP) is the primary neurotoxic component in this pea. The present study attempted to evaluate the proteome-wide alterations in chick brain 2 hr and 4 hr post L-ODAP treatment. Proteomic analysis of chick brain homogenates revealed several proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure, signaling, cellular metabolism, free radical scavenging, oxidative stress and neurodegenerative disorders were initially up-regulated at 2 hr and later recovered to normal levels by 4 hr.
Since L-ODAP mediated neurotoxicity is mainly by excitotoxicity and oxidative stress related dysfunctions, this study further evaluated the role of L-ODAP in apoptosis in vitro using human neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32.
The in vitro studies carried out at 200 μM L-ODAP for 4 hr indicate minimal intracellular ROS generation and alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential though not leading to apoptotic cell death. L-ODAP at low concentrations can be explored as a stimulator of various reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated cell signaling pathways not detrimental to cells. Insights from our study may provide a platform to explore the beneficial side of LODAP at lower concentrations. This study is of significance especially in view of the Government of India lifting the ban on cultivation of low toxin Lathyrus varieties and consumption of this lentil."

Post-thaw cleavage was similar among treatments, while the developmental rates of mouse blastocyst and hatched blastocyst were higher (p<0.05) in 27 hr and 30 hr than 21 hr. The developmental rate of hatched blastocyst at vitrified cleavage mouse embryos in cryo-loop was significantly higher than vitrified pronuclear embryos of control group as well as EM-grid and OPS (p<0.05). The developmental rate using cryo-loop was higher than EM-grid, but in case of OPS at vitrified cleavage and mouse pronuclear embryos, no significant difference was noticed. These results of our study show that the developmental rates of mouse embryos were unaffected by various vitrification containers, but in case of mouse embryos and hatched blastocysts at late vitrified pronuclear embryos the developmental rates were higher than early vitrified pronuclear embryos. Moreover, the developmental rate of hatched blastocyst at vitrified cleavage mouse embryos was significantly higher than vitrified pronuclear embryos. For better execution of this study, it will be mandatory to include improvement of vitrification containers, cryopreservation methods and conditions, higher survival rate, safe preservation, contamination and embryo loss."
568,"Comparison of the Duration of Hamstring Flexibility Improvement Following Termination of Modified Dynamic Stretching, Hold-Relax, and Static Stretching",문아영,2014,한국전문물리치료학회,"The aim of this study was to compare the duration of hamstring flexibility improvement after 3 stretching interventions in people with limited hamstring flexibility. Twenty-two subjects (12 men, 10 women) with limited hamstring flexibility of the dominant leg received 3 stretching interventions—modified dynamic stretching (MDS), hold-relax (HR), and static stretching (SS)—in a random order. All the subjects received all 3 interventions at intervals of at least 24 hours to minimize any carry-over effect. Modified dynamic stretching was applied as a closed kinetic chain exercise in the supine position by using the sling suspension system (Redcord Trainer®). The SS and HR interventions were individually performed in the straight leg raising (SLR) position, and all 3 interventions were performed for 3 minutes. Outcome measures included passive knee extension (PKE) measurements. Five post-test measurements were recorded for all subjects at 3, 6, 9, 15, and 30 minutes after the interventions. MDS was associated with a significant increase in knee extension range of motion even at 30 minutes post-treatment. In contrast, the HR and SS stretching methods showed increased hamstring flexibility for only 6 minutes post-treatment. Improvements in the range of motion of knee extension (indicating enhancement in hamstring flexibility) with MDS were maintained longer than those with the HR and SS interventions. Therefore, MDS may be more effective than the other interventions for maintaining hamstring flexibility."
569,Value of surgical resection compared to transarterial chemoembolization in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus: A meta-analysis of hazard ratios from five observational studies,Kang Keera,2020,한국간담췌외과학회,"Backgrounds/Aims: Although systemic therapy is recommended in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), treatment options for advanced HCC with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) are debatable. Recent studies have recommended other treatments, such as surgical resection (SR) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) between the two modalities using previous reports in order to compare the two treatment options. Methods: A systematic review was performed on previously reported data that compared the survival benefits of SR and TACE in patients with advanced HCC with PVTT.
Thereafter, the meta-analysis was performed to determine the cumulative HR between the two different treatment groups. We used the HR and 95% CI directly from the original data, when available; however, if these data were unavailable, reconstruction was performed with the secondary data from the original Kaplan-Meier survival curve.
Results: A total of seven studies were eligible; however, 2 were excluded from the meta-analysis. The remaining 5 studies that included 1422 patients (SR group=559, TACE group=863) were studied for the meta-analysis. The median OS was longer in the SR group (8.2-64 months in SR vs. 6.6-32 months in TACE), proving that SR offered survival benefits. Moreover, the HR for the OS in the TACE group was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.43-1.88) compared to SR group, depicting that TACE was a less favorable option compared to SR. Conclusions: There is evidence that SR may be a better viable option for advanced HCC with PVTT."

The responses to the emotional stimuli of each subjects were assessed by measuring and analysing the physiological signals before and during presenting negative emotional movie scenes; the parameters were the heart rate (HR), respiration(RESP), skin conductance level (SCL), skin conductance response (SCR), corrugator muscle (CM), and orbicularis muscle (OM), respectively. Patients reported that they have experienced strong emotions in responses to the stimuli of disgust, fear and sadness. The identification rate of anger only was distinguishable between the patients and the controls. The changes in the physiological responses of the patients between the resting periods and emotion-induced state in anger (HR, CM), fear (SCR, RESP, CM), sadness (HR, RESP) were less significant compared to the changes in the control group. The control subjects exhibited significantly-increased values in eleven parameters; anger (HR, RESP, CM), disgust(OM), fear(SCR, SCL, RESP, CM, OM), and sadness(HR, RESP), while the patients showed significant changes only in three parameters; disgust (HR), fear (SCR), and sadness (RESP). This study show that the physiological responses in patients apparently differ from in controls while the subjective experience cannot tell the difference between the two groups.Schizophrenia, Emotion, Autonomic nervous system, Psychophysiology"

Administration of tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP) into the portal vein of male rats resulted in a rapid elevation of serum sorbitol dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase activities, which decreased gradually in 24 hr. Hepatic cysteine concentration was reduced in 3 hr, and recovered progressively, reaching a level greater than 200% of the normal value in 24 hr. GSH was increased both in liver and blood at 9 hr after t-BHP challenge, whereas hypotaurine or taurine was not altered. γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) activity was increased from 9 hr after t-BHP treatment,
but protein expression of the GCS-heavy subunit was not changed in liver. Activity or expression of cysteine dioxygenase was not affected by t-BHP treatment. Taken together, these data show that an acute oxidant challenge to the rats may induce upregulation of cysteine availability and GCS activity, resulting in an enhancement of hepatic GSH synthesis, but the increased cysteine level does not stimulate taurine synthesis via cysteine sulfinate pathway. It is indicated that the regulation of GSH and taurine biosynthesis from cysteine is not solely dependent on the cysteine concentration

In this study, for stably treating waste insulating oil containing PCBs, numerical calculation was performed on a furnace having a treatment volume of 21 kg/hr furnace with a high temperature plasma torch to analyse flow and temperature distribution in the main combustor, and the furnace was actually fabricated and was subject to a test. The test results agreed well with various design variables obtained from the numerical analysis, and flow distribution, temperature distribution, concentration distribution and residence time were calculated for designing a furnace with a treatment capacity of 210 Kg/hr and conclusions were obtained as follows: 1. According to the result of calculation on a pilot plant with a waste insulating oil treatment capacity of 21 kg/hr, a strong swirling flow is shown in a first reactor and the flow shows a lowed velocity and stabilized in a second reactor to be then discharged through an outlet. In the result of calculation for the temperature distribution, a mean temperature within the furnace is about 1,200 or less and an outlet temperature in a chimney is about 1,150℃. But in experiment, the outlet temperature of the chimney was about 1,200℃ which is higher than the calculation by about 50℃, and the reason is estimatively resulted from that a small amount of auxiliary fuel was used to stabilize operation of the furnace. 2. In the result of calculation of a designed reactor with a treatment volume of 210 kg/hr, the flow pattern was similar to that of the pilot plant and a mean temperature within the furnace was calculated to about 1,300℃, which is a sufficient temperature to completely decompose PCBs. Also, although distribution in a stay time can be varied according to trajectory of a waste insulating oil particle, a mean stay time is about 1.9 seconds when a temperature within the reactor is 1,300℃."

Four SBR systems have been operated and investigated for over 40 days. Average TOC removal efficiencies were about 71 % in all SBRs. The NH_4^+-N removal efficiency was increased as the increase of aeration time. After changing aeration time, the total nitrogen removal efficiencies of SBRs were shown as 35 %, 85 %, 75 % and 65 %, respectively. Higher phosphorus release and uptake were occurred as the decrease of the aeration time. After all, the overall phosphorus removal efficiency decreased and the deterioration of phosphorus removal was occurred when aeration time was over 4 hr. Denitrification in aerobic conditions was observed, which showed the presence of DNPAOs and DNGAOs. In batch experiments, PAOs were shown as the most important microorganisms for the phosphorus removal in this experiment, and the role of DNGAOs was higher than that of DNAPOs for the nitrogen removal."

The MLE was prepared by autoclaving at 121℃ for 15 min and treated with β-glucosidase for 9 hr. High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that only qercetin-3-β-D-glucose (QT-G) among quercetin (QT) glycosides of MLE, including QT-G, quercetin-3-O-glucose-6""-acetate (QT-GA), and rutin (RT), was converted into QT by 3 hr treatment with β-glucosidase. The in vitro peroxyl radical- and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity significantly increased after the enzyme treatment using β-glucosidase for 6 and 9 hr,respectively. The metal chelating activity increased after the enzyme treatment using β-glucosidase for 3 hr. The intracellular antioxidant capacity of MLE to protect AAPH- and Cu2+-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells significantly increased after the enzyme treatment using β-glucosidase for 3 and 6 hr, respectively, indicating that QT may be released from QT-G by β-glucosidase and penetrate into cell membrane so that it can contribute to the intracellular antioxidant capacity of MLE."

The antioxidative effects of quercetin and genistein onboar sperm characteristics and in vitro development of IVF embryo were investigated. The sperm motility wasincreased by addition of genistein 50 μM for 6 hr incubation compared to control (p<0.05). The sperm viability wasincreased by addition of quercetin 1 and 50 μM and genestein 1 and 50 μM for 3 hr incubation. In addition, thesperm viability seemed to be increased dose-dependantly by addition of quercetin or genistein 1 and 50 μM,respectively (p<0.05). The membrane integrities were not increased by quercetin or genistein treatments for 3 hr or6 hr incubation period except for quercetin 1 μM for 3 hr incubation. In mitochondrial activities, addition of quercetin50 μM for 6 hr incubation increased mitochondrial activity but decreased at 100 μM concentration compared withcontrol (p<0.05).
When porcine IVF embryos were cultured in PZM-3 medium supplemented with low concentrations of quercetin(1∼10 μM), the developmental rates to morula and blastocyst increased but significantly decreased at high concentrationsof quercetin (25∼50 μM). The highest developmental rate to blastocysts among all concentrations of quercetinwas shown at quercetin 10 μM (p<0.05). The developmental rates to morula or blastocysts at low (0.01∼1 μM) andhigh (5∼10 μM) concentrations of genistein were not significantly different among all treatment group and genisteindid not affect on IVF embryo development.
These results suggest that quercetin and genistein seem to have positive effects at certain concentrations on spermcharacteristics such as motility, viability and mitochondrial activity. In addition, low concentrations of quercetin (1,5 and 10 μM) in this experiment, seem to have beneficial effect on porcine IVF embryo development but genisteindid not affect on it at all given concentrations (0.01∼10 μM)."

Methods : We used two models; LPS-induced sepsis model for in vivo model, and murine peritoneal macrophages responses for in vitro. SME was administrated orally to mice. After 1 hr, LPS was injected intraperitoneally. Survival rate was checked each time per 12 hr for 5 days. Mice were sacrificed 3 hr after LPS injection, then blood samples and organs were harvested. Cytokines secretion was measured by ELISA. Organs tissues were observed with microscope. Murine peritoneal macrophages were cultured for 1 hr either in a medium alone or in a medium that contained SME, as indicated. Then, the cells were treated with LPS for 24 hr. mRNA levels of cytokines were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Cytokine levels in the supernatants were measured by ELISA. The amount of nitrite was measured by using the Griess method to evaluate NO production. The cell lysates were analysed by Western blotting using antibodies for iNOS and β-actin was used as an internal control to monitor equal protein loading.
Results : SME improverd the survival rate of mice model. SME inhibited the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and organs damages on Endotoxin Shock model. SME suppressed cytokine expression, cytokine secretion,NO production, iNOS expression in LPS-induced murine peritoneal macrophages.
Conclusions : The results suggest that SME has protective effects on endotoxin shock through suppression of inflammatory cytokines, organ damages, NO production and so on."

The oligonucleotides primer BION-23 generated 28 unique loci to each species in the SP species.
Especially, the oligonucleotides primer BION-25 produced 7 unique loci to each species, which were identifying each species in the SP species. BION-17 distinguished 21 shared loci by the three ascidian species, major and/or minor fragments of sizes, which were identical in almost all of the samples. Based on the average bandsharing values of all samples, the similarity matrix ranged from 0.519 to 0.774 in the SC species, from 0.261 to 0.683 in the HR species and from 0.346 to 0.730 in the SP species. As regards average bandsharing value (BS) results, individuals from SC species (0.661±0.081) exhibited higher bandsharing values than did individuals from HR species (0.555±0.074) (P<0.05). The dendrogram obtained by the seven oligonucleotides primers indicates three genetic groups. In three ascidian species, the shortest genetic distance (0.071) exhibiting significant molecular difference was also between individual no. 20 and no. 21 within the SP species."

VP는 -1℃에서 품온이 0℃가 될 때까지 40분간 행하였으며, 1 kg씩 PE포장하여 -1℃에서 30일간 저장하였다. 저장 중 중량감소율은 예냉처리구에서 다소 낮았다. 저장 4일째까지의 예냉구 포장내 O2 농도는 2.44-14.50 % /kg-package/hr로 대조구의 2.01- 8.19 %/kg-package/hr보다 현저하게 높았으며 저장 4일째까지의 평균 CO2 농도는 대조구 0.58 %/ kg-package/hr, 예냉구 0.47 g/kg/hr로 예냉구에서는 저장초기에 호흡율이 크게 억제되었다. 대조구에서는 저장 4일째 CO2/O2값의 peak을 나타낸 반면 예냉구에서는 이러한 현상이 보이지 않았다. 저장중 예냉구는 대조구에 비하여 백색도가 높고 적색 및 황색도가 낮았다. 예냉구는 대조구에 비하여 견고성, 경도 및 씹힘성은 유의적으로 높았으나 탄력성과 점착력은 비숫하였다. 30일간 저장한 경우 대조구에서는 주름 부위가 연화되는 현상이 나타났으나 예냉처리구에서는 이러한 현상들이 현저하게 적었다. 또, 버섯자루의 단면조직을 관찰한 결과 예냉구는 망상으로 된 도관이 선명하게 관찰되었으나 대조구에서는 도관이 연화 또는 붕괴되어 형태가 뚜렷하지 않는 곳이 많았다. 이상의 결과 새송이의 수확 후 감압예냉은 저장중 선도유지에 효과가 있으며 산업적 활용이 기대된다.The effects of vacuum precooling(VP) on the shelf-life of polyethylene film(PE) packaged King oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus eryngii) during storage at -1℃ were investigated. VP was conducted below 0℃ in a -1℃ cold chamber of 40 minutes, and mushrooms were stored for 30 days in batches of 1kg. The weight loss of the VP-treated mushroom was slightly lower than that of control. The O2 concentrations of VP-treated mushroos, within 4 days of storage, were 2.44-14.50 % / kg-package/hr, thus higher than control values (2.01-8.19%/kg-package/hr). CO2 generation of VP-treated mushrooms, again within 4 days of storage, was 0.47% /kg-package/hr, thus lower than that of controls (0.58% /kg-package/hr). The CO2/O2 ratio peaked on day 4 of storage in the control group, tbut no such peak was observed in VP-treated mushrooms. In the VP-treated fungi, lightness was higher, and redness and yellowness lower, than in controls, at all storage times.. In VP-treated mushrooms, strength, hardness and chewiness were significantly higher than in controls, but there were no significant differemces in springiness or cohesiveness. Softening and breakdown of under-cap wrinkles were observed in control mushrooms stored for 30 days, but occurred to a lesser extent in VP-treated fungi. Stipe reticulum tissue vessels in the 30 day-stored VP-treated mushrooms were relatively well-defined and clear, but were softer and diffuse in the control fungi. The results thus confirmed that VP after harvest enhanced mushroom shelf-life and PE packaging prolonged storage time. The data will have industrial applications.Pleurotus eryngii, vacuum pre-cooling, polyethylene film package, shelf-life."

The biologic effects of 1/100-, 1/50-, and 1/10-diluted bromfenac sodium, pranoprofen, diclofenac sodium, and the fluorometholone on corneal epithelial cells were evaluated after 1-, 4-, 12-, and 24-hr of exposure compared to corneal epithelial cell treated with balanced salt solution as control.
Cellular metabolic activity, cellular damage, and morphology were assessed. Corneal epithelial cell migration was quantified by the scratch-wound assay. Compared to bromfenac and pranoprofen, the cellular metabolic activity of diclofenac and fluorometholone significantly decreased after 12-hr exposure, which was maintained for 24-hr compared to control. Especially, at 1/10-diluted eye solution for 24-hr exposure, the LDH titers of fluorometholone and diclofenac sodium markedly increased more than those of bromfenac and pranoprofen. In diclofenac sodium, the Na+ concentration was lower and amount of preservatives was higher than other NSAIDs eye solutions tested. However, the K+ and Cl- concentration, pH, and osmolarity were similar for all NSAIDs eye solutions.
Bromfenac and pranoprofen significantly promoted cell migration, and restored wound gap after 48-hr exposure, compared with that of diclofenac or fluorometholone. At 1/50-diluted eye solution for 48-hr exposure, the corneal epithelial cellular morphology of diclofenac and fluorometholone induced more damage than that of bromfenac or pranoprofen. Overall, the corneal epithelial cells in bromfenac and pranoprofen NSAID eye solutions are less damaged compared to those in diclofenac, included fluorometholone as steroid eye solution."
594,"The meat quality, muscle fiber characteristics and fatty acid profile in Jinjiang and F1 Simmental×Jinjiang yellow cattle",Yue Zheng,2018,아세아·태평양축산학회,"Objective: This study compared the meat quality, muscle fiber characteristics, and fatty acids between Jinjiang yellow cattle (JJ) and F1 Simmental×Jinjiang yellow cattle (SJ) which were offered the same diet.
Methods: Six JJ and six SJ individuals were reared and fattened from 10 to 26 months of age. After feeding, the highrib (HR), ribeye (RB), and tenderloin (TL) samples were taken from the carcass for meat quality evaluations.
Results: The results showed that growth performance of SJ was higher than that of JJ (higher live weight and average daily gain), and the hot carcass weight of SJ was higher than that of JJ (p<0.05). pH of JJ was higher than that of SJ in TL (p<0.05); the color of a* of SJ was higher than that of JJ in TL and RB (p<0.05); the cooking loss of SJ was significantly lower than that of JJ in TL and RB (p<0.05); the shear force value was significantly lower in SJ compared to JJ (p<0.05); the muscle fiber diameter was higher and the fiber density was lower in SJ compared to JJ in HR and TL (p<0.05); compared to SJ, the muscles of JJ had higher saturated fatty acid (SFA) composition; the sum of monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) were lower in the muscle of JJ; the mRNA expressions of myosin heavy chain-I (MyHC-I) and MyHC-IIa were higher in SJ compared to JJ in muscle of HR and RB; the mRNA expressions of MyHC-IIx and MyHC-IIb were lower in SJ compared to JJ in HR and RB (p<0.05).
Conclusion: Meat quality and fatty acid profile differed between SJ and JJ; the muscle of SJ had higher a* and SFA; SJ had lower cooking loss, shear force and PUFA compared to the muscle of JJ.

To investigate the change in liver toxicity, firstly, TAA (30 ppm/100 g of fish) was intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered 12 hr after the intramuscular (i.m.) injection of Taurine-FTM (0.02 ml/100 g of fish)(Taurine/TAA). Secondly, Taurine-FTM was i.m. injected 24 hr after the administration of TAA (TAA/Taurine). Finally, TAA was administered simultaneously with Taurine-FTM (TAA+Taurine). All blood samples were collected 24 hr after injection. GOT level in group Taurine/TAA appeared similar to the control, whereas group TAA/Taurine and TAA+Taurine showed significantly increased (p<0.05) levels compared to the control. In GPT level, group Taurine/TAA and TAA/Taurine showed elevated levels compared to the control, whereas no significant difference was observed between group TAA+Taurine and the control. Serum ACH50 activity was significantly (p<0.05) augmented 24 hr after Taurine-FTM injection compared to the control group, whereas no significant increase was observed 48 hr after Taurine-FTM injection. On the other hand, serum lysozyme activity elevated in an acute stressed condition appeared significantly down-regulated 24 and 48 hr after Taurine-FTM injection compared to the control. In conclusion, i.m. injected Taurine-FTM augmented flounder serum complement activity and decreased a possible handling stress resulting in reducing a serum lysozyme activity and recovering hepatotoxicity. Thus, it is assumed that i.m. injection of Taurine-FTM mixed with antibiotics or available vaccines could be utilized as an anti-hepatotoxic recipe in fish culture industry."

The HRTs were operated on 4 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr. DO concentrations were ranged 1.5~2.0 mg/L and 0.5~1.0 mg/L respectively on each HRT conditions. MBR was divided into an aerated part and non-aerated part by baffle placed under the water. DO concentrations were controlled by altering the position of baffle. In terms of TSS and CODCr, all systems had a similar level of the removal under varied HRTs and MLSS. TSS removal efficiency was more than 99% and CODCr removal was ranged 94~97% under all conditions. Under the same condition on the HRT and MLSS concentrations, DO concentrations did not affect the organic removal efficiency. On the nitrification efficiency, with high DO concentration, as HRT or MLSS increased, the slight increment of nitrification efficiency was observed. However, under the low DO concentration, increase of MLSS and HRT resulted in larger increase of the nitrification efficiency. At the same HRT and MLSS, the nitrification efficiency increased greatly with up to 16% as DO increased. When the HRT increased from 4hr to 8hr, the denitrification efficiency slightly increased under most of conditions. However, the increase of MLSS resulted in about 19~39% denitrification efficiency increment. MLSS concentrations showed great effect on the denitrification. The increase of the DO concentration at the same HRT and MLSS resulted in decrease of denitrification efficiency with up to 27%. In all systems, the denitrification efficiency had more influence on the TN removal efficiency than nitrification efficiency. So, MLSS concentration has greater effect on the TN removal than HRT and DO. The TN removal efficiency increased as MLSS increased with up to 37%. As a result, the highest TN removal efficiency was observed 79.0% at the condition showed the highest denitrification efficiency that DO of 0.5~1.0 mg/L, an HRT of 8 hr, and 8,000 mg/L of MLSS concentration were maintained.Denitrification, Membrane Bio-Reactor(MBR), Nitrification, Simultaneous Nitrification and Denitrification (SND)"
604,Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia to manage the postoperative pain in patients undergoing craniotomy,나효석 /Na， Hyo-Seok,2011,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: his randomized controlled study evaluated the eicacy of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) with fentanyl and ketorolac for neurosurgical patients, and compared the effectiveness of IV-PCA with intermittent analgesics injection.
Methods: he patients undergoing craniotomy were randomly assigned to two groups. Patients of group P (n = 53)received fentanyl (0.2 μg/kg/hr) and ketorolac (0.3 mg/kg/hr) via IV-PCA, and those of group N (n = 53) received intermittent fentanyl or ketorolac injection as needed. Pain was evaluated using a 0-10 visual analogue scale (VAS)at postoperative 1, 4, and 24 hr. he amount of infused analgesic drugs, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, systolic arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and the incidence of nausea and miosis were measured at the same time points.
Results: Although VAS of pain (VASp) was comparable at postoperative 1 hr (P = 0.168) between the two groups, the group P had signiicantly lower VASp at postoperative 4 hr (P = 0.007) and 24 hr (P = 0.017). In group P, less analgesic drugs were administered at postoperative 1 hr, and more analgesic drugs were administered at postoperative 24 hr.
here were no diferences between two groups with respect to nausea, GCS, systolic arterial pressure, and heart rate.
IV-PCA did not further incur respiratory depression or miosis.
Conclusions: IV-PCA with fentanyl and ketorolac after craniotomy is more effective analgesic technique, without adverse events, than the intermittent administration of analgesics."
605,Effects of Pellet Moisture Content on the Physical Properties of Vacuum-puffed Yukwa,Xiao-jun Shen,2011,한국산업식품공학회,"The effects of pellet moisture content on physical properties (expansion ratio, density and breaking strength) of vacuum-puffed Yukwa (non-oil puffed Yukwa) were investigated in this study. The Yukwa was made from the waxy rice steeped at 25 and 30℃ for 3, 5 and 10 days with pellet drying times (6, 8 and 10.5 hr), respectively. As the drying time increased from 6 to 10.5 hr at 50℃, the highest value of pellet moisture content (29.4%) was found in the samples made from the steeped waxy rice at 25℃ for 5 days after 6 hr drying, while the lowest value (16.3%) was found at 25℃ for 3 days after 10.5 hr drying. Both redness and yellowness values of vacuum-puffed Yukwa increased as the drying time increased. The expansion ratio of Yukwa was greatly affected by drying time,ranging from 2.07 (26.8% pellet moisture content) to 7.01 (24.0% pellet moisture content). From the data, it was concluded that the pellet moisture content had a significant influence on the physical characteristics of vacuumpuffed Yukwa. With vacuum puffing condition of 3 min heating and 2 min puffing, the pellets with about 25%moisture content showed higher expansion ratio, and lower density and breaking strength."

Five kinds of proteases (Alcalase, Neutrase, Protex-40L, PTPF-1430, and KMFP-15) were tested at different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3%, w/v) during hydrolysis at 55 for 4 hr. Hydrolysis with ℃ KMFP-15 showed the lowest pH by 7.3. The highest soluble solid (24.3 °Brix) and free amino acid (4,944 mg%) contents were obtained by hydrolysis with KMFP-15 (w/v) at 0.2% addition level, which was not significantly different from the sample hydrolyzed at 0.3% level. Under the optimal condition of KMFP-15 at 0.2%, porcine blood was hydrolyzed at 60 up to 8 hr. The ℃ free amino acid content reached the highest at 4 hr, and then decreased with longer hydrolysis time. Under the optimal hydrolysis conditions, porcine blood hydrolysis powder had plenty of crude proteins, amino acids, and minerals, including iron, potassium, and zinc. The results showed that porcine blood could be utilized as an useful source of food supplement. The optimum conditions of hydrolyzing porcine blood, using 0.2 KMFP at 60℃ for 4 hr, can be used in the commercial production of protein supplements, amino acid sources, and iron fortifying agents"

Baldissera,2014,대한기생충학ㆍ열대의학회,"The aim of this study was to verify the trypanocidal effectiveness of aqueous, methanolic, and ethanolic extracts of Achyrocline satureioides against Trypanosoma evansi in vitro. A. satureioides extracts, known as macela, were used on trypomastigotes at different concentrations (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 µg/ml) and exposure times (0, 1, 3, 6, and 9 hr). A dose-dependent effect was observed when the 3 extracts were tested. The concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 µg/ml were not able to kill trypomastigotes until 3 hr after exposure, and the highest concentrations (500 and 1,000 µg/ml) were able to kill all trypomastigotes after 1 hr. When the time of exposure was increased up to 9 hr, the concentrations at 50 and 100 µg/ml were 100% effective to 3 extracts. The chemical analysis of the extracts revealed the presence of flavonoids, a trypanocidal compound already described. Based on the results, we can conclude that the A. satureioides extracts exhibit trypanocidal effects."

Genetically modified organisms (GMO) were developed via molecular breeding technology. Currently, molecular breeding technologies facilitate efficient plant breeding without introducing foreign genes, in virtue by of gene editing technology.
Gene targeting (GT) via homologous recombination (HR) is one of the best gene editing methods available to modify specific DNA sequences in genomes. GT utilizes DNA repair pathways. Thus, DNA repair systems are controlled to enhance HR processing. Engineered sequence specific endonucleases were applied to improve GT efficiency.
Engineered sequence specific endonucleases like the zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), TAL effector nuclease (TALEN), and CRISPR-Cas9 create DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) that can stimulate HR at a target site. RecQl4, Exo1 and Rad51 are effectors that enhance DSB repair via the HR pathway. This review focuses on recent developments in engineered sequence specific endonucleases and ways to improve the efficiency of GT via HR effectors in plants."

614,Prognostic Influence of BCL2 on Molecular Subtypes of Breast Cancer,황기태 /Ki-Tae Hwang,2017,한국유방암학회,"Purpose: We aimed to reveal the prognostic influence of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) on molecular subtypes of breast cancer.
Methods: We analyzed 9,468 patients with primary breast cancer.
We classified molecular subtypes according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and St. Gallen guidelines, mainly on the basis of the expression of hormonal receptor (HR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki-67.
Results: Regarding NCCN classification, BCL2 was a strong favorable prognostic factor in the HR(+)/HER2(–) subtype (p<0.001) and a marginally significant favorable prognosticator in the HR(+)/HER2(+) subtype (p=0.046). BCL2 had no prognostic impact on HR(–)/HER2(+) and HR(–)/HER2(–) subtypes. In relation to St. Gallen classification, BCL2 was a strong favorable prognosticator in luminal A and luminal B/HER2(–) subtypes (both p<0.001). BCL2 was a marginally significant prognosticator in the luminal B/HER2(+) subtype (p=0.046), and it was not a significant prognosticator in HER2 or triple negative (TN) subtypes.
The prognostic effect of BCL2 was proportional to the stage of breast cancer in HR(+)/HER2(–), HR(+)/HER2(+), and HR(–)/HER2(–) subtypes, but not in HR(–)/HER2(+) subtype.
BCL2 was not a prognostic factor in TN breast cancer regardless of epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Conclusion: The prognostic influence of BCL2 was different across molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and it was largely dependent on HR, HER2, Ki-67, and the stage of cancer. BCL2 had a strong favorable prognostic impact only in HR(+)/HER2(–) or luminal A and luminal B/HER2(–) subtypes, particularly in advanced stages.
Further investigations are needed to verify the prognostic influence of BCL2 on molecular subtypes of breast cancer and to develop clinical applications for prognostication using BCL2."

Soil infiltration flow was measured on-site and SS load by the filter part was calculated by the experimental data in laboratory reactor test. Soil infiltration flow was measured to be about 1 m3/hr in soil condition saturated with water. The filter part of the infiltration grate inlet was a hydraulic equipment unhindered by soil infiltration on the bottom of the storage tank, because the infiltration flow was measured to be about 3 m3/hr continuously in the closing infiltration hole condition. Infiltration flow and SS load were over about 1 m3/hr and 1.71 kg according to laboratory results by the filter part using the artifical sample. Therefore, the above values could be presented as the limitted value to start the reduction of filtration effect. Reduction efficiencies of SS load by the filter part for the rainfall intensity were about 87 % at 5 mm/hr and about 61 % at 10 mm/hr in consideration of one infiltration grate inlet got the drainage area about 200 m2. The reduction efficiency of nonpoint source pollutants was very effective in the first flush rainfall. However, the reduction efficiency by rainfall density was higher than by flow."

Methods: White-spotted flower chafer larvae powders were prepared by applying the following three methods: oven-dried larvae powder (OLP), oven-dried at 100ºC for 16 hr without any pretreatment process; frozen and oven-dried powder (FOLP), frozen at -20ºC for 24 hr and oven-dried at 100ºC for 16 hr; and frozen and freeze-dried larvae powder (FFLP), frozen at -70ºC for 24 hr and freeze-dried (-45ºC, 0 m Torr) for 5 days. Results: No differences were observed in the moisture content and crude ash content among the larvae powders (p>0.05). However, FFLP exhibited lower crude protein and crude fat contents compared to OLP and FOLP treatments (p<0.05). The order of protein solubility in the white-spotted flower chafer larvae powder was determined to be FFLP (95.66%) > FOLP (76.20%) > OLP (68.71%) (p<0.05). Moreover, the results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that FFLP had significantly lower onset and peak temperatures, but higher ΔH than OLP and FOLP treatments. The results from protein SDS-PAGE indicate that although larvae powders prepared with the oven-drying process (OLP and FOLP treatments) present decreased intensity of protein bands (< 50 kDa), a new protein band (70~100 kDa) was also observed. Conclusion: The results of this current study indicate that freeze-drying could be an excellent pre-treatment method to produce white-spotted chafer larvae powder with minimizing the protein denaturation. Moreover, if oven-drying conditions (time and temperature) are fixed, freezing prior to oven-drying reduces the extent of protein denaturation in white-spotted flower chafer larvae powder as compared to direct oven-drying of the raw ingredient."

The optimal conditions for ethanol production were obtained by standing culture at 25℃ for 5 days with 5% inoculum volume. At the results by flask culture, the growth curve of used S. cerevisiae reached to the stantionary phase at 48 hr and the death phase at 90 hr, whereas ethanol production reached maximum at 114 hr. Under the above conditions, a large scale production was carried out. A standing culture in 5 l fermenter showed the similar results to its flask culture, but progressed 24 hr rapidly more than that of the flask culture. A fed-batch culture was performed by addition of the onionic medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) sucrose after 72 hr from the fermenting start. The fed-batch culture could prevent S. cerevisiae from entering into the death phase and maintain constant level of alcohol production. A continuous culture was able to carry out by adding per every 24 hr the onionic medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) sucrose after 72 hr from the fermenting start. Although S. cerevisiae used showed a little decreased growth, alcohol production maintained roughly the constant level at the maximum yield. To enhance the quality of this alcoholic drink, 2-Ο-α-D-glucopyranosyl L-ascorbic acid (AA-2G) was supplemented into the onion extract of the substrate for fermentation. As resulted at this study, this alcoholic drink containing AA-2G should be used as a functional fermented alcohol drink strengthened with vitamin C.양파는 우리 식생활에서 자주 사용되는 식품 재료로서 그 재배 방법이 용이하여 전국 각지에서 많이 생산되고 있다. 양파 내에는 glutamic acid, arginine 등 다양한 종류의 아미노산이 들어 있어서 그 효능을 증가시킨다. 본 연구에서는 이러한 장점을 가지고 있는 양파의 수요 확대 및 국민 건강 증진을 위하여 양파즙을 기질로 하여 알코올 발효 조건을 검토하고 나아가 발효주의 품질을 개선하여 산업화를 위한 발판을 마련하고자 하였다. 플라스크 배양 결과, 48시간 경에 정지기로 접어들었고, 90시간 이후에 사멸기로 나타났다. 에탄올 생성은 114시간에서 정점을 보였다. 플라스크 배양의 최적 조건을 토대로 하여 유가 배양, 연속 배양 등 발효조 배양을 행하였다. 발효조 정치배양은 플라스크 배양과 유사한 결과를 보였지만, 약 24시간 정도 빠르게 진행되었다. 유가배양은 배양 시작 후 72시간 때 10% sucrose가 첨가된 양파즙 배지를 첨가하여 실시되었고, 균의 사멸을 방지하고 알코올의 일정농도를 유지하게 했다. 연속배양은 배양 시작 후 72시간 때부터 24시간 간격으로 연속적으로 신선한 배지를 균 생육이 유지되게 하였다. 그 결과 균 생육은 다소 감소하였지만, 일정농도의 알코올 생성은 가능한 것으로 나타났다. 또한 생체 내에서 항괴혈병 작용, 면역 촉진 작용 등의 생리 활성을 나타내는 비타민 C (L-ascorbic acid)의 유도체인 2-O-α- D-glucopyranosyl L-ascorbic acid (AA-2G)를 양파즙 배지에 첨가하여 알코올 발효의 특성을 분석하여 발효주의 비타민 C를 강화하고 면역 증강을 촉진시키는 기능성 발효주로의 가능성을 확인하였다."
620,흰쥐 모델에서 Capsaicin이 소장 콜레스테롤 및 중성지방 흡수율에 미치는 영향,서윤정,2009,한국식품영양과학회,"Capsaicin has been shown to affect lipid metabolism. However, it is currently not known whether capsaicin would lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of intraduodenally infused capsaicin on the lymphatic absorption of cholesterol and lipids in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300~350 g were starved for 16 hr and the mesenteric lymph duct was cannulated. Each rat was infused at 3.0 mL/hr for 8 hr via the duodenal catheter with a lipid emulsion, which contained 33.3 kBq [14C]-cholesterol, 20.7 μmol cholesterol, 452 μmol triolein, 3.1 μmol α-tocopherol, and 396.0 μmol Na-taurocholate without (control) or with 5.0 mg capsaicin in 24 mL PBS buffer (pH 6.4). Simultaneously, lymph was collected hourly for 8 hr. There was no significant difference in lymph flow between the groups. However, the lymphatic absorption of 14C-cholesterol for 8 hr was significantly lower in rats infused with capsaicin than in those infused with no capsaicin. Also, the output of oleic acid for 8 hr was significantly decreased by capsaicin. However, the intestinal absorption of α-tocopherol did not differ between the groups. The results indicate that the luminal infusion of capsaicin inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and lipids in rats."

In an attempt to investigate the effect of MMP activation in development cumulus-oocytes complexes, we examined the localization and expression of MMP, and monitored MMP expression profile. Cumulus-oocytes complexes were collected and matured in vitro for 24 hr, 36 hr and 48 hr. A mRNA expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 was detected in all culture medium regardless of CC, OC and COCs. Activity of MMP-2 in the OC progressively was increased from 24 hr to 48 hr. But MMP-9 was not detected in all culture medium. The localization of MMP-2 was also measured by immunohistochemistry analysis. The MMP-2 and TIMP-2 was detected in cumulus cell and oocyte zone pellucida. Expression of MMP-2 protein in the COCs was progressively increased from 24 hr to 48 hr. However, MMP-9 protein was progressively decreased from 24 hr to 48 hr. And TIMP-2 protein was most highly expressed in the COCs 36 hr. Expression of TIMP-3 protein in the COCs was progressively increased from 24 hr to 48 hr. In conclusion, these results suggest that MMP-2 plays a role in maintaining normal maturation and development by controlling the ECM inhibitor concentration on cumulus cell and oocytes."

For this purpose, 24-hr integrated PM2.5 samples were collected and analyzed for ionic species. Hourly average PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations from OPS were 2.7 and 1.7 times higher than those from GRIMM OPC, respectively, and also 1.9 and 1.7 times higher than those from betaray absorption method (BAM). However, highest PM2.5/PM10 value was found in GRIMM OPC. The PM2.5/PM10 was 0.85±0.09, 0.50±0.20, and 0.53±0.17 for OPC, OPS, and BAM, respectively, indicating rather underestimation of PM10 from GRIMM OPC.
24-hr average PM2.5 from OPC and OPS was approximately 3% (an intercept of +9.3 μg/m3) lower and 63% (an intercept of +3.3 μg/m3) higher than that from the gravimetric method, respectively, with R2 values of 0.93 and 0.82. However, 24-hr average PM2.5 from BAM was strongly correlated with the gravimetric method with a slope of 0.96, an intercept of 3.4 μg/m3, and an R2 of 0.97, suggesting high reliability of BAM. Also the difference in 24-hr PM2.5 between gravimetric method and OPS increased negatively with increasing the concentrations of secondary inorganic components (=NO3 -+NH4 ++SO4 2-), NO3 -, NH4 +, and SO4 2- However, secondary ionic species concentrations were very poorly correlated (R2=~0.00) with the difference in 24-hr PM2.5 between the gravimetric method and GRIMM OPC, suggesting GRIMM dust monitor provides a reliable and real-time measurements of PM2.5. Finally, results from this study indicates that PM10 and PM2.5 from TSI OPS and PM10 from GRIMM OPC should be corrected to obtain their real concentrations based on the gravimetric method and/or BAM."

The biofilter process consist of an upflow anoxic reactor and two downflow oxic reactors. And operating conditions of biofiter process was that the hydraulic retention time decreased from 3.0 hr to 0.7 hr. BOD and TN removal rates achieved 87.7 % and 59.0 % at HRT 3.0 hr. According to decrease HRT 0.7 hr, BOD and TN removal rates were decreased as 84.9 % and 50.6 %. The performance of the biofilm process was also evaluated at different recycle ratios such as 50 %, 100 % and 150 %. At a recycle ratio of 150 %, the maximum removal rate of BOD and TN were 89.9 % and 73.4 %, respectively and concentrations of BOD and TN were less than 3.5 mg/L in effluent of biofilm process. And studying the removal characteristics of hydraulic retention time and distance because the biofilter process is plug flow reator. The organics removal and denitrification efficiency was highest at inlet(0.8 m ~ 1.5 m) of the anoxic reactor. In oxic reator, residual organics were removed at inlet(2.2 m ~ 2.9 m) and nitrification efficiency was active at middle section(1.5 m ~ 2.2 m). The results demonstrated that the biofilm process could treat low strength domestic wastewater effluent effectively at a short HRT. Furthermore, the recycle ratio had significant effect on the performance of the biofilm process."

A total polyphenol experiment was conducted to analyze phenolic contents of Celastrus orbiculatus fruits. Furthermore, DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and reducing power experiments were proceeded to measure the antioxidant activity. The Celastrus orbiculatus fruits were extracted in various times on D.W. so that the antioxidant activity was getting much active as the extracts were stronger. Also, the total polyphenol experiment processed with the 1000 ppm solutions extracted in 1 h, 2 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, and 12 hr. Each solutions showed the values of 51.88 mg/g, 53.98 mg/g, 62.80 mg/g, 69.94 mg/g and 69.92 mg/g respectively. The highest antioxidant activity showed while the experiments of DPPH, ABTS and FRAP is conveyed with the 8 hour extracted solutions, and the reducing power experiment with the extracted 12 hour solution. WSCs dissolved in D.W. to make them 1000 ppm, the experiments are conducted with each 1000 ppm solutions in the various time zones and volume fraction ratio of the WSCs. Through these experiments, the mixture of the extracted Celastrus orbiculatus fruits and WSCs showed much higher antioxidant activity than only WSCs. As the volume of the Celastrus orbiculatus fruits extraction was getting bigger, the antioxidant activity increased. The result obtained that extracted Celastrus orbiculatus fruits have the antioxidant effect and the effect becomes higher when the WSCs are mixed with the extracted Celastrus orbiculatus fruits."
627,Estimating excess post-exercise oxygen consumption using multiple linear regression in healthy Korean adults: a pilot study,정원상 /Jung Won-Sang,2021,한국운동영양학회,"[Purpose] This pilot study aimed to develop a regression model to estimate the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) of Korean adults using various easy-to-measure dependent variables.
[Methods] The EPOC and dependent variables for its estimation (e.g., sex, age, height, weight, body mass index, fat-free mass [FFM], fat mass, % body fat, and heart rate_sum [HR_sum]) were measured in 75 healthy adults ( 31 males, 44 females). Statistical analysis was performed to develop an EPOC estimation regression model using the stepwise regression method.
[Results] We confirmed that FFM and HR_sum were important variables in the EPOC regression models of various exercise types. The explanatory power and standard errors of estimates (SEE) for EPOC of each exercise type were as follows: the continuous exercise (CEx) regression model was 86.3% (R2) and 85.9% (adjusted R2), and the mean SEE was 11.73 kcal, interval exercise (IEx) regression model was 83.1% (R2) and 82.6% (adjusted R2), while the mean SEE was 13.68 kcal, and the accumulation of short-duration exercise (AEx) regression models was 91.3% (R2) and 91.0% (adjusted R2), while the mean SEE was 27.71 kcal. There was no significant difference between the measured EPOC using a metabolic gas analyzer and the predicted EPOC for each exercise type.
[Conclusion] This pilot study developed a regression model to estimate EPOC in healthy Korean adults. The regression model was as follows: CEx = -37.128 + 1.003 × (FFM) + 0.016 × (HR_sum), IEx = -49.265 + 1.442 × (FFM) + 0.013 × (HR_sum), and AEx = -100.942 + 2.209 × (FFM) + 0.020 × (HR_sum)."

The average critical water temperature of the subjects was 16.5±1.2(SE)℃ with suits and 28.8±0.4℃ with swim suits. At rest, the total peripheral insulation of the subjects was higher with wet suits(0.499±0.039(SE)℃/(kcal/hr·m²)) than with swim(0.156±0.015) by about 0.343℃/(kcal/hr·m²), a value significantly greater than the physical insulation of the wet suit(0.12℃/(kcal/hr·m²)). With exercise, the total insulation declined as an exponential function of the exercise intensity in both wet suited and swim suited subjects, the effect being more pronounced in the later. In wet suited subjects, the extra-insulation due to wet suit decreased from about 0.28℃/(kcal/hr·m²) at rest to 0.12℃/(kcal/hr·m²) at exercise levels above 200% of the resting metabolism.
These results suggest that in resting subjects immersed in cold water the overall thermal Insulation is dramatically increased by wearing wet suits not only due to the physical insulation provieded by the suit itself, but also due to more effective physiological regulation of peripheral circulation. The later effect of the wet suit is lost during exercise. There practical significance of the finding is dicussed."

631,Effect of Therapeutic Hypothermia on Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Pathways in the Brain Tissue of a Swine Cardiac Arrest Model,계유찬 /Yu Chan Kye,2016,대한응급의학회,"Purpose: To investigate the change in mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in the brain tissue after therapeutic hypothermia in the swine cardiac arrest model.
Methods: After the return of spontaneous circulation by cardiopulmonary resuscitation, following a 6 min of no-flow time induced by ventricular fibrillation, pigs (n=24) were randomly assigned to one of four groups (sham, normothermia, 24 hr of therapeutic hypothermia, 48 hr of therapeutic hypothermia). After 24 or 48 hr of therapeutic hypothermia (core temperature 32-34􀆆C), the pigs were then rewarmed to 36℃ for a period of 8 hr. At 60 hr upon the return of spontaneous circulation, the pigs were sacrificed and brain tissues were harvested.
Results: We measured the tissue levels of p38, JNK, and ERK pathway expressions from the hippocampus of the swine brain in all four groups. The phosphorylated p38-to-p38 ratio and phosphorylated JNK-to-JNK ratio were significantly increased in all of the intervention groups compared with the sham group. The phosphorylated ERK-to-ERK ratio was increased only in the therapeutic hypothermia groups (p-value=0.026 in the 24 hr of therapeutic hypothermia group and p-value=0.002 in the 48 hr of therapeutic hypothermia group, compared with the sham group).
Conclusion: The p38 and JNK pathways were also activated during therapeutic hypothermia and normothermia.
However, the ERK pathway was activated only in therapeutic hypothermia. Therapeutic hypothermia activated the ERK pathway in ischemia-reperfusion injury of the brain tissue after cardiac arrest, which seemed to be dependent on the duration of therapeutic hypothermia."

A single oral dose of 10 mg of test formulation RamiprinR (tablet) or reference formulation Tritace ProtectR (tablet) was administered with one-week washout period. Plasma concentrations of ramipril were assayed over a period of 12 hr with a well validated method using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The values of area under the plasma concentration-time curve, from time zero to last sampling time (AUCt) and from time zero to time infinity (AUCinf) were 77.45  44.78 and 78.96  45.64 for test, and 70.30  42.27 and 71.99  43.55 ngáhr/mL for reference formulation, respectively. Similarly, maximum concentration (Cmax) and elimination half-life (t1/2) were 65.61  19.96 ng/mL and 2.15  0.75 hr for test, and 63.63  25.50 ng/mL and 2.16  0.73 hr for reference formulations, respectively. Time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) for the test and the reference, were 0.51  0.22 hr and 0.52  0.18 hr, respectively. The parametric 90% confidence intervals on the mean of the differences between the two formulations (test-reference) of the log-transformed values of AUCt and Cmax were 1.03 to 1.19 and 0.98 to 1.17, respectively. The overall results indicate that the two formulations are bioequivalent and can be prescribed interchangeably."
634,Changes in Some Physico-Chemical Properties and γ-Aminobutyric Acid Content of Kimchi during Fermentation and Storage,오석흥 /SukHeung Oh,2008,한국식품영양과학회,"In this study, we investigated changes in some physico-chemical and biochemical properties of Kimchi during fermentation and storage. After fermenting Kimchi at 15oC for 23, 36, 40, 44, and 60 hrs during the first week, we stored it at -1oC in a Kimchi refrigerator until the end of 8th week. The pH of samples fermented for 36 hr, 40 hr, 44 hr and 60 hr sharply decreased during the first seven days and then slowly decreased. Acidities of samples fermented for 36 hr, 40 hr and 44 hr sharply increased for the first seven days. According to measured changes of lactic acid bacteria number, samples fermented for 60 hr revealed the largest augmentation in the number of lactobacilli for the first seven days. The γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content of the sample fermented for 40 hr was the most superior, with an early increase and maintenance of GABA content, which maintained a maximum 20 mg per 100 g of Kimchi sample on the seventh, fourteenth, and twenty eighth days. These results suggest that relatively enhanced levels of GABA in Kimchi samples can be produced and maintained by controlling the fermentation and storage processes, as with the 40 hr fermented sample conditions."
635,Performance of chromID Clostridium difficile Agar Compared with BBL C. difficile Selective Agar for Detection of C. difficile in Stool Specimens,한상봉,2014,대한진단검사의학회,"We evaluated the performance of a new chromogenic medium for detection of Clostridium difficile , chromID C. difficile agar (CDIF; bioMérieux, France), by comparison with BBL C.
difficile Selective Agar (CDSA; Becton Dickinson and Company, USA). After heat pre- treatment (80°C, 5 min), 185 diarrheal stool samples were inoculated onto the two media types and incubated anaerobically for 24 hr and 48 hr for CDIF and for 48 hr and 72 hr for CDSA. All typical colonies on each medium were examined by Gram staining, and the gram-positive rods confirmed to contain the tpi gene by PCR were identified as C. difficile .
C. difficile was recovered from 36 samples by using a combination of the two media. The sensitivity with CDIF 48 hr was highest (100%) and was significantly higher than that with CDIF 24 hr (58.3%; P <0.001), because samples with a low burden of C. difficile tended to require prolonged incubation up to 48 hr ( P <0.001). The specificity of CDIF 24 hr and CDIF 48 hr (99.3% and 90.6%, respectively) was significantly higher than that of CDSA 48 hr and CDSA 72 hr (72.5% and 67.1%, respectively; P <0.001). CDIF was effective for detecting C. difficile in heat-pretreated stool specimens, thus reducing unnecessary test- ing for toxin production in non- C. difficile isolates and turnaround time."

RIN-5F cells cultured in high glucose decreased cell viability and increased ROS levels after 48 hr compared with standard medium (5.5 mM glucose). Glucotoxicity was confirmed by significantly increased ROS production, increased pro-inflammatory (IFN-γ, IL-1β,) & decreased anti-inflammatory (IL-6&IL-10) cytokine levels, increased DNA fragmentation. In addition, we found increased Bax, caspase 3, Fadd, and Fas and significantly reduced Bcl-2 expression after 48 hr. RIN-5F treated with both high glucose and AE (20 mM) decreased ROS generation and prevent RIN-5F cell from glucotoxicity. In addition, AE treated cells cultured in high glucose were transferred to standard medium, normal responsiveness to glucose was restored within 8hr and normal basal insulin release within 24 hr was achieved when compared to high glucose."

638,Feasibility of Selective Neck Irradiation with Lower Elective Radiation Dose in Treating Nasopharynx Cancer Patients,조원경 /won kyung cho,2019,대한암학회,"Purpose This study aimed to report the clinical outcomes following selective neck irradiation (SNI) with lower elective radiation therapy (RT) dose in treating nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients.
Materials and Methods A total of 347 NPC patients received definitive RT according to our SNI policy and were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical target volumes (CTVs) were subdivided into CTV at high risk (CTV-HR) and CTV at low risk (CTV-LR). The typical doses to gross tumor volume (GTV), CTV-HR, and CTV-LR were 68.4-70.0 Gy, 54.0-60.0 Gy, and 36.0 Gy.
Results With the median follow-up of 68.1 months (range, 2.3 to 197.1 months), the 5-year rates of loco-regional control and progression-free survival in all the patients were 85.0% and 70.8%, respectively. Thirty patients developed regional failure and the regional control rates at 3 and 5 years were 92.6% and 91.4%, respectively. The sites of regional failure in relation to the target volume were exclusively inside GTV/CTV-HR in 20, inside and outside GTV/CTVHR in three, and exclusively outside GTV/CTV-HR in seven, which were 5.7%, 0.9%, and 2.0% of total patients, respectively.
Conclusion The clinical outcomes by the current SNI policy were feasible and comparable to those following classic elective nodal irradiation policy."
639,소아중환자에서 분무용 살부타몰 용량과 심박수와의 상관관계 분석,고은비,2019,한국병원약사회,"Background : Nebulized-salbutamol is often used for patients hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in need of respiratory support. However, there is a lack of references to establish a guideline for dosage adjustment according to each age group. Thus, the purpose of this study was to analyze the correlation between the dose of nebulized-salbutamol and heart rate (HR) in critically ill pediatric patients.
Methods : This study included critically ill pediatric patients younger than age 18, who stayed in the PICU at Seoul National University Children’s Hospital July 1, 2015 July 31, 2018. The correlation between the change of HR and the dose of nebulized-salbutamol was analyzed. After that, there was an effort to identify further risk factors which can contribute to increasing HR during PICU hospitalization.
Results : There was a total of 340 cases of 87 patients who were administered nebulized-salbutamol within the first 24 hours of PICU hospitalization. There was no statistical difference in HR changes between the high dosage group (≥0.2 mg/kg/dose) and the low dosage group ( 0.2 mg/kg/dose) for the first 24 hours of administration (p=0.058). The subgroup analysis was conducted using 268 cases excluding 72 cases where body temperature change was observed. There was significant increase of HR in the high dosage group (p=0.017). Twenty-five of 87 patients showed a more rapid HR after the administration of nebulized-salbutamol during PICU hospitalization. Among patients younger than age 36 months, there was a statistically significant correlation between HR rise (OR=8.739; 95% CI, 2.146-35.590; p=0.002) and the high dosage of nebulized-salbutamol (OR=4.204; 95% CI, 1.384-12.776; p=0.011).
Conclusions : The use of high dosage nebulized-salbutamol in critically ill pediatric patients may have the potential to increase HR. Thus, close monitoring is recommended when it is administered to young patients with high dosage."
640,Effects of Hwalgidan on Hepatic Injury Induced by Carbon Tetrachloride in Rats,Eun-Ju Kim,2007,한국실험동물학회,"Hepatoprotective effects of Hwalgidan® on both acute hepaotoxicity and chronic liver fibrosis and cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCI₄) were investigated in rats. In acute hepatotoxicity model, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were injected intra peritoneally with CCI₄ at a dose of 1.0 ㎖/㎏ (20% in corn oil, 5 ㎖/㎏). Hwalgidan® was treated orally at doses of 100 or 500 ㎎/㎏ 4 hr and 30 min prior to as well as 4 hr and 20 hr after CCI₄ challenge. The rats were anesthesized with intraperitoneal injection of urethane (16.5% in saline, 6 ㎖/㎏) 4 hr following final Hwalgidan® treatment (24 hr after CCI₄ injection), and administered with bromosulphalein (SSP) solution (1% in saline, 2 ㎖/㎏). The blood concentration of SSP was quantified 21 and 46 min after intravenous administration. Also, complete blood counts and biochemical parameters related to hepatic injury in accordance with histopathological findings were analyzed. In chronic liver fibrosis and cirrhosis model, male SO rats were orally administered with CCI₄ at a dose of 1.0 ㎖/㎏ (50% in corn oil, 2 ㎖/㎏) for 33 days at 3-day intervals followed by 20-day recovery or daily Hwalgidan® (100 or 500 ㎎/㎏) treatment. Liver weights, blood biochemical parameters related to hepatic injury, histopathological findings in accordance with hydroxyproline concentrations were analyzed before and after Hwalgidan® treatment. Acute CCI₄ injection caused centrilobular congestion and hepatocytic degeneration, resulting in disintegration of hepatic cords, and thereby not only greatly increased blood biochemical markers related to hepatic injury and cholestasis, but also significantly delayed SSP clearance. Hwalgidan® (500 ㎎/㎏) markedly recovered the CCl₄-induced changes in blood biochemical values and SSP clearance, reducing hepatic lesion score to 1.72 from 2.50 in control group. Chronic exposure to CCI₄ reduced the body weight gain and induced overall hepatocytic fatty degeneration and extensive fibrosis, resulting in 5-fold increase in hyroxyproline level. Although Hwalgidan® did not affect the body and liver weights, it facilitated the recovery of blood biochemical values related to hepatic injury, hepatic lesions and fibrosis, and hydroxyproline contents. Taken together, it is suggested that Hwalgidan® might prevent acute hepatotoxicity and enhance the recovery of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis induced by CCI₄, and that Hwalgidan® or its ingredient could be a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of hepatic disorders.Carbon tetrachloride(CCI₄), hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, Hwangidan, hepatoprotection"

Ternary αbcc-Al8Fe2Si and αhcp-Al8Fe2Si intermetallic compounds formed at the interface of SKD61 tool steel by interaction diffusion of Al, Fe and Si atoms after 0.5hr and 6hr immersion time, respectively. Binary η-Fe2Al5 additionally formed at the interface of SKD61 tool steel after 10hr immersion time. Thickness of soldering reaction layer in die surface increased as immersion time increased from 0.5hr to 24hr. Sludge formation was ascertained in the samples which were immersed in the melts more than 10hr. Reaction of die soldering after sludge formation was more accelerated than that of before sludge formation due to a decrease in Fe content, followed by higher diffusion rate of Al in the melt by sludge formation."
643,Development and evaluation of a food frequency questionnaire for Vietnamese female immigrants in Korea: the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES),김선혜,2011,한국영양학회,"The objectives of this study were to develop a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for Vietnamese female immigrants in Korea and to evaluate the validity of the FFQ. A total of 80 food items were selected in developing the FFQ according to consumption frequency, the contribution of energy and other nutrients, and the cooking methods based on one-day 24 hour recall (24HR) from 918 Vietnamese female immigrants between November 2006 and November 2007. The FFQ was validated by comparison with 24HR of 425 Vietnamese female immigrants between November 2008 and August 2009. The absolute nutrient intake calculated from the FFQ was higher than that estimated by 24HR for most nutrients. The correlation coefficients between 24HR and FFQ ranged from 0.10 (vitamin C) - 0.36 (energy) for crude intake, 0.05 (vitamin E) - 0.32 (calcium)for per 1000 kcal, and 0.08 (zinc) - 0.34 (calcium) for energy-adjusted, respectively. More than 70% of subjects were classified into the same or adjacent agreement groups for nutrients other than fiber, sodium, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E, while less than 10% of subjects were classified into complete disagreement groups. We conclude that the FFQ appears to be an acceptable tool for estimating nutrient intake and dietary patterns of Vietnamese female immigrants in Korea. Future studies to validate the FFQ using various biomarkers or other dietary assessment methods are needed."

Methods: Platelet concentrates were inoculated with 5 bacterial species to give a final concentration of 100,101 and 102 CFU/mL. Samples for culture were taken immediately after inoculation (0 hr sample) and after 24 hrs (24 hr sample). For the BacT/ALERT 3D system, a 10 mL sample was inoculated into an aerobic culture bottle and incubated for 7 days. For the Pall eBDS system, 3 mL samples were taken from the 0 hr and 24hr samples, respectively. The samples were incubated for 24 hrs and 30 hrs.
Results: Both systems detected all inoculated units both in the 0 hr and 24 hr samples, except for units inoculated with K. pneumoniae. Eleven units out of 30 units inoculated with K. pneumoniae were detected by the BacT/ALERT 3D system in the 24 hr samples. The Pall eBDS system detected 8 of 30 units in the 24 hr samples.
Conclusion: Implementation of either system will decrease the risk of transfusing bacterially contaminated platelets. However, testing for bacterial contamination will not completely prevent septic transfusion reactions;pathogen inactivation that is now available should also be considered as an alternative method to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination."

We evaluated the effect of propofol and desflurane anesthesia on the surgery-induced immune perturbation in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to receive propofol (n = 20) or desflurane (n = 20) anesthesia. The total and differential white blood cell counts were determined with lymphocyte subpopulations before and 1 hr after anesthesia induction and at 24 hr postoperatively. Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 were also measured. Both propofol and desflurane anesthesia preserved the IL-2/IL-4 and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio. Leukocytes were lower in the propofol group than in the desflurane group at 1 hr after induction (median [quartiles], 4.98 [3.87-6.31] vs. 5.84 [5.18-7.94] 103/μL) and 24 hr postoperatively (6.92 [5.54-6.86] vs. 7.62 [6.22-9.21] 103/μL). NK cells significantly decreased 1 hr after induction in the propofol group (0.41 [0.34-0.53] to 0.25 [0.21-0.33] 103/μL), but not in the desflurane group (0.33 [0.29-0.48] to 0.38 [0.30-0.56] 103/μL). Our findings indicate that both propofol and desflurane anesthesia for breast cancer surgery induce a favorable immune response in terms of preservation of IL-2/IL-4 and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in the perioperative period. With respect to leukocytes and NK cells, desflurane anesthesia is associated with less adverse immune responses than propofol anesthesia during surgery for breast cancer.

646,Migration of Osteoblast-like Cells on Extracellular Matrices-coatedCulture Plate Using Cell Tracking System,손주현,2004,한국생체재료학회,"In this study, the migration of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells was examined on the culture plate coated with ECM, such as type I collagen, laminin or fibronectin. The cells were incubated in a self-made mini-incubator, with the same conditions as commercial CO2 incubator, placed on an inverted microscope and observed as a real time-mode. After 24 hr of incubation, the edge and center of single cell were detected by an automated cell tracking system. From the cell movement path, it was shown that the cells had a tendency to move randomly without any certain direction. Furthermore, it could be found that the cell movement speed was divided into three phases, attachment preparation phase, from 0 to T1 hr, accelerated movement phase, from T1 to T2 hr and speed maintenance phase, till 24 hr. At first phase, a cell moved slightly as like searching a local attachment site. Afterwards, the cell accelerated its speed and reached the maximum speed, Vmax. To estimate the cell migration speed, the migration index was defined as the value of the Vmax divided by T2-T1. The migration index of the MC3T3-E1 cells on fibronectin was 8.9, while those indexes on the type I collagen and laminin were respectively 5.3 and 5.1. These results suggested that all cells might have their own migration index according to their species or phenotypes and ECM type, and the migration speed could be inferred from those values without further study."

Nuclear statuswas classified as germinal vesicle (GV), germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), prophase-metaphase I (PI-MI), andPII-MII under microscope. In Experiment 2, to investigate PN formation, oocytes were fertilized with Percoll-treatedfreshly ejaculated sperm (1 × 105 cells/ml) in mTBM with 0.3% BSA and 2 mM caffeine for 5 hr, and cultured inNCSU-23 medium with 0.4% BSA. At 6 hr of culture, the embryos were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 48 hr andstained with 10 ug/ml propidium iodide for 30 min. PN status was classified as no or one PN (unfertilized), 2 PN(normal fertilized) and 3 PN (polyspermy). Differences between groups were analyzed ≥ using one-way ANOVAafter arc-sine transformation of the proportional data. The rate of oocytes that had reached to PII-MII weresignificantly (P<0.05) higher in all groups added EGF than that of non-treated group (67%), but it did not differamong the all added groups (86%, 85%, 79% and 81%, in 5, 10, 20 and 40 ng/ml EGF, respectively). No differenceson the incidence of 2PN were observed in all treated groups (25%, 30%, 33%, 29% and 29%, in 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40ng/ml EGF, respectively), however, in non-treated group, polyspermy tended to be increased (66% vs. 58%, 54%, 52%and 55%, 0 vs. 5, 10, 20, 40 ng/ml EGF, respectively). These results suggest that EGF can be effectively used as anadditive for enhancing oocyte maturation and reducing the incidence of polyspermy in pig.

Although the hardness was slowly increased during storage period from 0 hr to 8 hr and sharply increased after 12 hr of storage in case of 0.5 bar steam pressure, it was slowly increased after 12 hr storage time in case of steaming pressure at 1.0 bar. Hardness rate constant of Baeksulgi was 0.217～ 0.184 hr-1 at range of steaming time for 8～10 min and pressure at 0.8～1.0 bar which was relatively low. Hardness and elasticity of sensory evaluation were increased with the increases in steaming pressure, steaming time, and storage period but cohesiveness was decreased. The highest overall preference was steaming pressure at 10 bar, steaming time for 10 min, and storage period for 12 hr. In conclusion, steaming pressure, steaming time, and storage period influenced Baeksulgi quality such as hardness and sensory characteristics."

Thirty consecutive children between 6 months and 2 yr of age were enrolled. At the end of surgery, a PrCA device with a basal infusion rate of 2 mL/hr and bolus of 0.5 mL with lockout time of 15 min was applied. Parents were educated in patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices, the Wong Baker face pain scoring system, and monitoring of adverse effects of fentanyl.
Fentanyl was infused 0.3 g/kg/hr at first, and we obtained a predetermined fentanyl regimen by the response of the previous patient to a larger or smaller dose of fentanyl (0.1 g/kg/hr as the step size), using an up-and-down method. ED50 and ED95 by probit analysis were 0.63 g/kg/hr (95% confidence limits, 0.55-0.73 g/ kg/hr) and 0.83 g/kg/hr (95% confidence limits, 0.73-1.47 g/kg/hr), respectively.
Eighty seven percent of the parents were satisfied with participating in the PrCA modality. PrCA using fentanyl with a basal infusion rate of 0.63 g/kg/hr can be applied effectively for postoperative pain management in children undergoing cleft palate repair with a high level of parents’ satisfaction."

A test condition was that activated sludge was completely prevented from contacting of oxygen (SNURclosed), the other was that activated sludge was contacted to free air (SNURopen). Municipal wastewater and acetate were used as electron donors. SNURclosed was 2.42 mg NO3-N/g VSS-hr and SNURopen was 1.09 mg NO3-N/g VSS-hr when municipal wastewater was used as electron donor. Meanwhile, when acetate was used as electron donor, SNURclosed was 24.65 mg NO3-N/g VSS-hr and SNURopen was 18.00 mg NO3-N/g VSS-hr. The operating costs for electron donors were calculated based on the unit price of acetate to remove nitrate. When municipal wastewater was used as electron donor the ratio of costopen to costclosed was 0.45. Cost evaluation showed the adverse impacts on denitrification and explained why an anoxic reactor should be sequestered from oxygen."

As a result of analysis, deviation in the lag time is significantly occurring from two hours to nineteen hours and fifty-five minutes depending on the rainfall intensity and the form of the flood hydrograph rising limb is being determined by this. It has been analyzed that the forest land is divided into the region where runoff does not occur even with the rainfall of more than 500 mm/hr and the region where runoff occurs 100% with the rainfall of more than 80 mm/hr and there is an upland field area where runoff does not occur even with the rainfall of more than 120 mm/hr and the area where runoff occurs 100% if the rainfall of more than 20 mm/hr occurs while runoff may occur 100% in the land and rice paddy with the rainfall of 20 mm/hr.

Methods: Data were pooled from 12 cross-sectional studies for cervical cancer screeningsfrom 10 provinces of China in 1999–2007. A total of 16,422 women were analyzed, alongwith 2,392 high-risk-HPV (hr-HPV) positive women and 381 CIN2+ cases. Pooled odds ratios(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression modelscontrolling for sexual and non-sexual confounding factors.
Results: There was an excess risk between active smoking and hr-HPV infection and CIN2+.
Adjusted OR for ever smokers vs. never smokers was 1.45 (95% CI=1.10–1.91), for hr-HPVinfection and 1.89 (95% CI=1.03–3.44), for CIN2+. Passive smoking had a slightly increasedrisk on the hr-HPV infection with adjusted OR 1.11 (1.00–1.24), but no statistical associationwas observed between passive smoke exposure and CIN2+. Compared with the neither activenor passive smokers, both active and passive smokers had a 1.57-fold (95% CI=1.14–2.15)increased risk of HPV infection and a 1.99-fold (95% CI=1.02–3.88) risk of CIN2+.
Conclusion: Our large multi-center cross-sectional study found active smoking couldincrease the risk of overall hr-HPV infection and CIN2+ adjusted by passive smoking andother factors. Passive smoking mildly increased the risk of HPV infection but not the CIN2+.

This study was conducted on comparison of 3 nutritional questionnaires to determine energy intake (EI) accuracy in adults in Ravansar Non-Communicable Chronic Disease (RaNCD) cohort study. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 118 of participant's RaNCD. EI was evaluated with 3 questionnaires including food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), 24-hours recall (24HR), and food habits questionnaire (FHQ). Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured using indirect calorimetry. We used EI/RMR cut off to evaluate EI reporting status. The mean ± standard deviation of age in men and women were 44.1 ± 6.5 and 43.7 ± 5.25 respectively and 50.8% of participants were men. Among 3 EI estimating questionnaires, FFQ was more accurate than 2 other questionnaires (67.8%). We observed that implausible reporters of 24HR were likely overweight (p < 0.005) but we did not observe a significant difference between EI reporting of FFQ and FHQ with participants' body composition. Our finding showed that EI underreporting of 24HR and FHQ were high. Under reporters were seemed to be overweight. Therefore, these results suggested that among 3 nutritional questionnaires the FFQ was an appropriate approach to determine EI in this population due to plausible EI reporting was higher than 2 other nutritional questionnaires (24HR and FHQ)."

Exercise protocol was comprised of a resting stage, Bruce stage II, Bruce stage III, and a recovery stage. To measure HR, subjects held smartphone in their hands and put the tip of their index finger on the built-in camera for 1 minute at each exercise stage such as resting stage, Bruce stage II, Bruce stage III, and recovery stage. The smartphones recorded photoplethysmography signal and HR was calculated every heart beat. HR data obtained from the smartphone during the exercise protocol was compared with the HR data obtained from a Holter electrocardiography monitor (control).Results In each exercise protocol stage (resting stage, Bruce stage II, Bruce stage III, and the recovery stage), the HR averages obtained from a Holter monitor were 76.40±12.73, 113.09±14.52, 115.64±15.15, and 81.53±13.08 bpm, respectively. The simultaneously measured HR averages obtained from a smartphone were 76.41±12.82, 112.38±15.06, 115.83±15.36, and 81.53±13 bpm, respectively.

658,Expression of Myxovirus Resistance A (MxA) Is Associated with Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)–Positive Breast Cancers,이소정 /Sojeong Lee,2017,대한암학회,"Purpose The prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has been determined in breast cancers. Interferons can affect T-cell activity through direct and indirect mechanisms.
Myxovirus resistance A (MxA) is an excellent marker of interferon activity. Here, we evaluated TILs and MxA expression in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive breast cancers.
Materials and Methods Ninety cases of hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2+ tumors and 78 cases of HR–/HER2+ tumors were included. The TILs level was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin–stained full face sections, and MxA expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry with a tissue microarray.
Results MxA protein expression was significantly higher in tumors with high histologic grade (p=0.023) and high levels of TILs (p=0.002). High levels of TILs were correlated with high histological grade (p=0.001), negative lymphovascular invasion (p=0.007), negative lymph node metastasis (p=0.007), absence of HR expression (p < 0.001), abundant tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) around ductal carcinoma in situ (p=0.018), and abundant TLSs around the invasive component (p < 0.001). High levels of TILs were also associated with improved disease-free survival, particularly in HR–/HER2+ breast cancers. However, MxA was not a prognostic factor.
Conclusion High expression of MxA in tumor cells was associated with high levels of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancers. Additionally, a high level of TILs was a prognostic factor for breast cancer, whereas the level of MxA expression had no prognostic value."

Methods: In a hospital-based cohort, a total of 21,568 women were voluntarily enrolled from March 2009 to November 2016 for evaluating the 3 current cervical cancer screening strategies: co-test, cytology primary and high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) primary by using PCRRDB HPV genotyping and liquid-based cytology (thinprep cytologic test [TCT]). Women with HR-HPV infection and/or abnormal cytology were referred for colposcopy, and the biopsy or conization was performed according to the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines. Results: Overall, 18.20% (3,935/21,568) of the women were detected as HR-HPVpositive, 5.04% (1,088/21,568) were diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or higher (CIN2+), and 3.43% (739/21,568) with CIN3+. The cumulative incidence rates for CIN2+/CIN3+ in patients with HPV-16/18-positive were 48.28%/37.20%, while they were 0.86%/0.38%, 0.30%/0.15% and 0.18%/0.09% in cytology-negative, HR-HPV-negative and co-test-negative population, respectively. Using CIN2+ and CIN3+ as the observed endpoints, the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of HR-HPV genotyping as a primary screening tool were 90.99%/99.49% and 91.57%/99.80%. Moreover, using HR-HPV genotyping primary screening could detect the same more CIN2+/CIN3+ cases in baselinedetection as co-testing (990/700 vs. 991/701) and far more than cytology primary screening (903/656, p<0.05). It also achieved the lowest misdiagnosis rate (8.01%/5.02%). Although HPV genotyping primary screening required an increased number of colposcopies (2.75/3.89 per CIN2+/CIN3+ case), it yielded an acceptable rate. Conclusions: The PCR-RDB HPV genotyping test is a cost-effective and beneficial cervical cancer primary screening for hospital-based opportunistic screening..."

The physico-chemical characteristics ofthe synthesized parent (NaY and ZSM-5) and hierarchical (UHR/Y and HR/ZSM-5) samples wereextensively characterized by XRD, FTIR, TGA, SEM, NH3-TPD, ICP, N2-ads/desorption techniques. The ICPresults revealed that post-synthesis approaches successfully washed off Al and Si atoms from the zeolitesframework and increased the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios from 3.13 to 6.20 and from 65.55 to 86.34 in UHR/Y andHR/ZSM-5 samples, respectively. Also, the BET analysis showed significant increase in the average porediameter (DP) size for UHR/Y (31%) and HR/ZSM-5 (153%) compared to their parent ones. Similarly,mesoporous pore volume (Vmeso) exhibited notable surge of 100% and 700% for UHR/Y and HR/ZSM-5,respectively in comparison with their parent forms. The synthesized parent and hierarchical zeoliteswere used in preparation offluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst. Catalyst performance was examined invacuum gas oil (VGO) cracking through a micro-activity test (MAT) unit. Products of interest includinggasoline, propylene, and total olefins exhibited significant yield increase from 29.80 to 50.87, 3.93 to16.41, and 7.36 to 24.98 wt%, respectively over the FCC-4 catalysts which prepared by hierarchical (UHR/Yand HR/ZSM-5) zeolites. The enhanced catalytic activity can be attributed to the absence of diffusionproblems and more accessibility of the acid sites in the hierarchical zeolite structure."

The contaminated soil was obtained from the site near smelting factory. The soil was highly contaminated in approximately 15,000 mg/kg by Pb. 0.05 M EDTA and 0.1 M citrate solutions were selected for soil washing of the contaminated soil. After 1 hr-5 step extraction, Pb removal efficiencies of contaminated soil were 84.44% in EDTA and 70.42% in citrate solution, respectively. For EDTA soil washing, Cu removal efficiency in 1 hr-5 step extraction increased to 57%, while it was 35% in 12 hr-one step. For citrate soil washing, Pb removal efficiency in 1 hr-5 step extraction greatly increased to 70.4%, compared to 44.5% of 12 hr-one step. Multi step extraction efficiency was shown more distinctly in citrate than EDTA. After 0.05 M EDTA soil washing, TCLP results for Pb permitted EPA regulatory level in both 12 hr-one step and 1 hr-5step extraction. However, TCLP result for Pb did not permit EPA regulatory level in 12 hr-one step extraction using 0.1 M citrate. Danger Indices after EDTA soil washing were more decreased than citrate."
666,Effect of a professional soccer match in skin temperature of the lower limbs: a case study,Alex de Andrade Fernandes,2017,한국운동재활학회,"The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between lower limbs skin temperature (Tsk) recorded by infrared thermography and creatine kinase (CK) response following an official soccer game. A pro-fessional soccer player, from the first division Brazilian League, defender, 27 years and 183 cm of height was analyzed. Measures of Tsk with a thermal camera and blood CK concentrations were obtained 24 hr be-fore (24H-PRE), 24 (24H-POST) and 48 hr (48H-POST) after an official match. The results showed that CK values were 193 U/L 24 hr before, ris-ing to 1,083 U/L 24 hr after the game and 414 U/L 48 hr after the game. Anterior thigh Tsk was 31.5ºC, 33.8ºC, and 31.8ºC in the moments 24H-PRE, 24H-POST, and 48H-POST, respectively. Similarly, anterior leg presented temperature of 31.2ºC, 33.3ºC, and 31.5ºC at the same moments. Qualita-tive analysis of the thermograms showed that whole lower limbs are much warmer 24 hr after the match and certain areas as the right anteri-or thigh, the left anterior leg, both anterior ankles, and both posterior thighs have not fully recovered their initial Tsk 48 hr after the match. The results of this study indicate that participation in a professional soccer match can lead to significant increases in Tsk values measured by IRT 24 hr after the match. Considering this variable as an indicator of muscu-lar damage, it could help in the process of training control, being part of an injury prevention program in professional soccer clubs."
667,Acute effects of endurance exercise on nocturnal autonomic functions in sedentary subjects: a pilot study,Emi Yuda,2018,한국운동재활학회,"Nocturnal heart rate variability (HRV) is thought to reflect healthy recov-ery function of the autonomic nervous system. Although exercise is recommended for health promotion, exercise itself decreases HRV. We studied acute effect of daytime exercise on nocturnal HRV in 5 healthy adults (age, 22–40 years; 2 female subjects) without regular exercise habit. Using a treadmill, they performed 30-min walking at 4 km/hr and 30-min running at 9 km/hr from 11 a.m. on different days at an interval of 2 weeks. On these days and a day without exercise (control), Holter electrocardiograms were recorded from 9 a.m. for 24 hr. The amplitudes of low-frequency (LF, 0.04–0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF, 0.15–0.45 Hz) components of HRV were measured continuously by complex de-modulation and were averaged over periods of 11:00–11:30 a.m., 3 hr af-ter going to bed, and time in bed at night. Exercise intensities of the walking and running were at 10% to 44% and 55% to 67% of heart rate reserve, respectively. During exercise, heart rate increased and LF and HF amplitudes decreased with exercise intensity. Nocturnal heart rate and LF and HF amplitude, however, showed no consistent changes with exercise intensity and their averages on the days of walking and run-ning did not differ significantly from those of the control day. In conclu-sion, 30-min walking and running exercises performed in the morning had no significant acute effects on nocturnal heart rate or HRV."

669,Assessment of Fluid Shifts of Body Compartments using Both Bioimpedance Analysis and Blood Volume Monitoring,유수정,2006,대한의학회,"Fluid shifts are commonplace in chronic hemodialysis patients during the intra- and interdialytic periods. In this study, we evaluated fluid shifts of body compartments using both bioimpedance spectroscopy and blood volume monitoring from the start to the end of hemodialysis. 24 stable hemodialysis patients were included on the study. Relative change of blood volume was progressively reduced from the start to the end of hemodialysis (1 hr, -7.22±3.23%; 2 hr, -9.78±4.69%; 3 hr, -12.88± 5.65%; 4 hr, -15.41±6.54%, respectively). Mean % reduction of intracellular fluid was not significantly different to that of extracellular fluid at the end of hemodialysis ( ICF, -6.58±5.34% vs. ECF, -7.07±5.12%). Mean % fluid reduction of arms, legs and trunk was -11.98±6.76%, -6.43±4.37% and -7.47±4.56%, respectively at the end of hemodialysis. There were 3 characteristic patterns in blood-volume change. Similar amounts of fluid were removed from the extracellular and intracellular compartments during hemodialysis, with the arms showing the greatest loss in terms of body segments. The pattern of blood volume change measured by blood volume monitoring may be useful for more accurate determination of dry-weight and for correcting volume status in hemodialysis patients."

674,NecroX-5 exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects via modulation of the TNFα/Dcn/TGFβ1/Smad2 pathway in hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated rat hearts,Vu Thi Thu,2016,대한약리학회,"Inflammatory and fibrotic responses are accelerated during the reperfusion period, and excessive fibrosis and inflammation contribute to cardiac malfunction. NecroX compounds have been shown to protect the liver and heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to further define the role and mechanism of action of NecroX-5 in regulating infl ammation and fi brosis responses in a model of hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR). We utilized HR-treated rat hearts and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated H9C2 culture cells in the presence or absence of NecroX-5 (10 μmol/L) treatment as experimental models. Addition of NecroX-5 signifi cantly increased decorin (Dcn) expression levels in HR-treated hearts. In contrast, expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) and Smad2 phosphorylation (pSmad2) was strongly attenuated in NecroX-5-treated hearts. In addition, signifi cantly increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), TGFβ1, and pSmad2, and markedly decreased Dcn expression levels, were observed in LPS-stimulated H9C2 cells. Interestingly, NecroX-5 supplementation effectively attenuated the increased expression levels of TNFα, TGFβ1, and pSmad2, as well as the decreased expression of Dcn. Thus, our data demonstrate potential anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of NecroX-5 against cardiac HR injuries via modulation of the TNFα/Dcn/TGFβ1/Smad2 pathway."

Therefore, the current trial attempted to evaluate the efficacy of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) priming in remission induction chemotherapy with an intensified dose of Ara-C for newly diagnosed AML. Patients with newly diagnosed AML were randomly assigned to receive idarubicin (12 mg/m2/24 hr, days 1-3) plus Ara-C (500 mg/m2/12 hr,days 4-8) with G-CSF (250 μg/m2/d, days 3-7) (IAG group) or standard idarubicin (12mg/m2/24 hr, days 1-3) plus Ara-C (100 mg/m2/12 hr, days 1-7) without G-CSF (IA group). There were no significant differences in sex, age, subtype, or cytogenetic risk between the two groups. Complete remission was achieved in 15 patients (88.2%) from the IAG group and in 14 patients (82.4%) from the IA group (p=0.31). The median time to complete remission was 26 vs. 31 days (p=0.779) for the IA and IAG groups,respectively. The median time to neutrophil recovery (＞1×109/L) and platelet recovery (＞20×109/L) did not differ significantly between the two groups (26 vs. 26 days, p=0.338;21 vs. 16 days, p=0.190, respectively). After a median follow-up of 682 days, the 3-year overall survival rate for the IA group was 64.7%, whereas that for the IAG group was 45.6% (p=0.984). No improved clinical outcomes were observed for the AML patients subjected to intensified remission induction with G-CSF priming when compared with standard induction chemotherapy."

In the result of the microorganism volume measurement of each reactor modules, the influent part has shown to have more than 1.7~2.3 times because the influent part has more organic material concentration than the effluent part. The microorganism SOUR value in the reactor has increased as much as about 5~20% as the EBCT has increased, the value at the influent part has increased more than at the effluent part up to about 50%. In this study, it has shown to be possible to remove as much as about 80% of the particulate, the organic material and the phosphate through the subsurface-flow wetland using the biological aerated filter technique. Therefore, it has been evaluated that the biological aerated filter reactor would be very effective as the purification device for the polluted stream water and the non-point pollution source."
678,Biological Clock and Ultradian Metabolic Oscillation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,권정숙 /Chong Suk Kwon,2018,한국생명과학회,"Biological clocks are the basis of temporal control of metabolism and behavior. These clocks are characterized by autonomous free-running oscillation and temperature compensation and are found in animals, plants, and microorganisms. To date, various biological clocks have been reported. These include clocks governing hibernation, sleep/wake, heartbeat, and courtship song. These clocks can be differentiated by the period of rhythms, for example, infradian rhythms (> 24-hr period), circadian rhythms (24-hr period), and ultradian rhythms (< 24-hr period). In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), at least five different autonomous oscillations have been reported; (1) glycolytic oscillations (T = 1~30 min), (2) cell cycle-dependent oscillations (T = 2~16 hr), (3) ultradian metabolic oscillations (T = 15~50 min), (4) yeast colony oscillations (T = a few hours), and (5) circadian oscillations (T = 24 hr). In this review, we discuss studies on oscillators, pacemakers, and synchronizers, in addition to the application of biological clocks, to demonstrate the nature of autonomous oscillations, especially ultradian metabolic oscillations of S. cerevisiae.생물시계(Biological clock)는 생명체에서 나타나는 반복되는 자율적인 리듬을 말하며, 단일세포는 물론 다세포 생명체의 기본적인 대사와 이에 따른 표현형과 행동을 직접적으로 조절하고 있다. 이러한 생물시계는 동면 리듬, 수면 리듬, 심장박동 리듬 및 짝짓기 노래 리듬 등 매우 다양하며, 24시간 이상의 주기를 infradian rhythm, 24시간 주기를 circadian rhythm, 24시간 이내의 짧은 주기를 ultradian rhythm으로 구분한다. 효모 Saccharomyces cerevisiae는 최소 5종 이상의 반복되는 자율적인 리듬이 알려져 있으며, 이중 일부는 생체시계로 인식되고 있다. 본 리뷰에서는 Saccharomyces cerevisiae의 glycolytic oscillation (T= 1~30분), cell cycle-dependent oscillation (T= 2~16시간), ultradian metabolic oscillation (T= 15~50분), yeast colony oscillation (T= 수 시간) 및 circadian oscillation (T= 24시간)에 대한 연구 결과를 제시하고, 특히 ultradian metabolic oscillation의 특징, 집단 동조인자(population synchronizer), 동조인자의 조절 기작 및 효모 생물시계의 대사공학 분야의 이용성을 제시하여 효모를 이용한 동적 대사조절 및 생물시계 연구가 가능함을 제시하였다."

683,(–)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) attenuates the hemodynamics stimulated by caffeine through decrease of catecholamines release,한진이 /Jin-Yi Han,2016,대한약학회,"A human study of the effects on hemodynamics of caffeine and epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) was performed. Caffeine tablets (200 mg) were orally administered to healthy males aged between 25 and 35 years 30 min after oral administration of EGCG tablets (100 and 200 mg). The increase in BP induced by caffeine was inhibited when co-administrated with EGCG. We found that caffeine slightly decreased heart rate (HR) in the volunteers. Although EGCG enhanced HR reduction, the effect was not significant. In addition, caffeine increased blood catecholamine levels, but EGCG inhibited the increase in noradrenaline, adrenaline and dopamine levels induced by caffeine. Whether EGCG decreases the elevated HR and systolic perfusion pressure, and ventricular contractility induced by adrenergic agonists in the isolated rat heart was investigated. The modified Krebs–Henseleit solution was perfused through a Langendorff apparatus to the isolated hearts of rats. HR, systolic perfusion pressure, and developed maximal rates of contraction (+dP/dtmax) and relaxation (-dP/dtmax) were increased by epinephrine (EP) and isoproterenol (IP). In contrast, EGCG decreased the elevated HR, systolic perfusion pressure, and left ventricular ±dp/dtmax induced by EP and/or IP. In conclusion, EGCG could attenuate the hemodynamics stimulated by caffeine through decreasing catecholamine release."

[Methods] NEAT was measured in 71 healthy adults (male n = 29; female n = 42). Statistical analysis was performed to develop a NEAT estimation regression model using the stepwise regression method.
[Results] We confirmed that ageA, weightB, heart rate (HR)_averageC, weight × HR_averageD, weight × HR_sumE, systolic blood pressure (SBP) × HR_restF, fat mass ÷ height2G, gender × HR_averageH, and gender × weight × HR_sumI were important variables in various NEAT activity regression models. There was no significant difference between the measured NEAT values obtained using a metabolic gas analyzer and the predicted NEAT.

As the results, It may be concluded that the ground water level in the slope supported by drainable upward soil nails increases very gradually while the unsupported soil changes dramatically. In addition, the ground water level becomes constant and no failure occurs as time goes by. In case of the relative density of 75%, the runoff ratio seemed to increase up to about 8~15% after reinforcement."

Eleven male(69.45±6.01 year old) and thirteen female(70.38±4.98 year old) participated in the study. Participants were asked to exercise with two different outdoor exercise equipments(cross-country and sky-walk). Subjects were asked to exercise at predetermined intensity for five minutes and their heart rate(HR), oxygen consumption(VO2) and rate of perceived exertion(RPE) were monitored. SPSS/PC + version 18.0 statistical software was used for the study. The results are as follows. HR and VO2 increased up to 137.88±17.59 bpm and 20.17±2.96 ml/min/kg during cross-country exercise. During sky-walk exercise, HR and VO2 increased up to 117.88±21.53 bpm and 14.67±4.60 ml/min/kg respectively. During sky-walk and cross-country exercise RPEs were increased up to 16.41±1.79 and 13.29±4.01 respectively. When these physiological responses were analyzed by gender, HR were increased more in female than male during sky walk exercise, however, their VO2 and RPE were significantly lower. During cross-country exercise, HR were increased more in female than male participants and VO2 and RPE were not different between each gender. When physiological responses to outdoor exercise equipment were analyzed according to their age (60-70 years old vs 70-80 year old), HR, VO2 and RPE were significantly higher among subjects whose ages are over 70 year old compared to subjects whose age are between 60-70 year old during sky-walk exercise. In summary, physiological responses to exercise using outdoor exercise equipment are gender dependent, however, generally these exercise result in physiological stress which is similar to moderate to high intensity level exercise."
690,Locoregional Recurrence by Tumor Biology in Breast Cancer Patients after Preoperative Chemotherapy and Breast Conservation Treatment,좌은진 /Eunjin Jwa,2016,대한암학회,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to determine whether breast cancer subtype can affect locoregional recurrence (LRR) and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and breast-conserving therapy (BCT).
Materials and Methods We evaluated 335 consecutive patients with clinical stage II-III breast cancer who received NAC plus BCT from 2002 to 2009. Patients were classified according to six molecular subtypes: luminal A (hormone receptor [HR]+/HER2–/Ki-67 < 15%, n=113), luminal B1 (HR+/HER2–/Ki-67  15%, n=33), luminal B2 (HR+/HER2+, n=83), HER2 with trastuzumab (HER2[T+]) (HR–/HER2+/use of trastuzumab, n=14), HER2 without trastuzumab (HER2[T–]) (HR–/HER2+, n=31), and triple negative (TN) (HR–/HER2–, n=61).
Results After a median follow-up period of 7.2 years, 26 IBTRs and 37 LRRs occurred. The 5-year LRR-free survival rates were luminal A, 96.4%; B1, 93.9%; B2, 90.3%; HER2(T+), 92.9%; HER2(T–), 78.3%; and TN, 79.6%. The 5-year IBTR-free survival rates were luminal A, 97.2%; B1, 93.9%; B2, 92.8%; HER2(T+), 92.9%; HER2(T–), 89.1%; and TN, 84.6%. In multivariate analysis, HER2(T–) (IBTR: hazard ratio, 4.2; p=0.04 and LRR: hazard ratio, 7.6; p < 0.01) and TN subtypes (IBTR: hazard ratio, 6.9; p=0.01 and LRR: hazard ratio, 8.1; p < 0.01) were associated with higher IBTR and LRR rates. A pathologic complete response (pCR) was found to show correlation with better LRR and a tendency toward improved IBTR controls in TN patients (IBTR, p=0.07; LRR, p=0.03).
Conclusion The TN and HER2(T–) subtypes predict higher rates of IBTR and LRR after NAC and BCT. A pCR is predictive of improved IBTR or LRR in TN subtype."

The subjects were 255 parents, whose children were 2∼5 year old and attended a childcare center, were grouped according to the recognition of CCFSM (high recognition, HR, 27.5%; medium recognition, MR, 47.4%; low recognition, LR, 25.1%). Information was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire and data were analyzed by SPSS 25.0. Only 58.6% of HR and 10.7% of MR answered the they had participated education/event held by the CCFSM. More parents in the HR group (88.6%) acknowledged the helpfulness of CCFSM on the children’s food habits compared to those in the MR group (63.6%) (P＜0.001). Compared to the MR and LR groups, more parents in the HR group answered not only that they were ‘satisfied’/‘very satisfied’ with the meals served by childcare centers (P＜0.05), but also they tended to think that their children were also satisfied (P=0.061). Up to 31.2% of parents in the LR group answered that there was no need for education to increase the vegetable intake of their child compared to 14.3% and 17.4% in the HR and MR groups, respectively (P＜0.05). Moreover, up to 26.6% of parents answered that school cook planned menus compared to 5.7% and 13.2% in the HR and MR group, respectively (P＜0.001). In conclusion, the results provided the association between parents’ high recognition of CCFSM and preschoolers’ satisfaction for meals from childcare centers as well as a better chance for a desirable food life regarding vegetable intake."

E Alleviate Alone or Synergetically Hydrogen Peroxide Induced-Oxidative Stress on Boar Sperm Characteristics during In Vitro Storage,Hyun Young Jang,2009,사단법인 한국동물생명공학회,"Antioxidants partially ameliorated the detrimental effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on sperm characteristics during in vitro storage. The objective of the present study was to investigate the single or synergetic antioxidative effect of curcumin and Vit. E on the characteristics of fresh boar sperm during in vitro storage. The sperm viability in curcumin, Vit. E supplementation and curcumin+Vit. E+H2O2 groups remained over 85.0% in 3 hr incubation period, but in 6 hr incubation period, curcumin+Vit. E+H2O2 groups was sharply dropped than those of curcumin and Vit. E group. The membrane intergrity in all evaluated groups except for H2O2 group did not significantly difference in 3 hr incubation period. The viability in curcumin or Vit. E supplementation were significantly increased than in curcumin+H2O2 and Vit. E+H2O2 group in 6 hr incubation period. The percentage of mitochondrial activity and acrosome intergrity obtained similar trends within same incubation periods irrespective of treatment. The lipid peroxidation of spermatozoal plasma membrane ranged from 11.6∼17.5 nM/l×106 and 14.0∼19.0 nM/l×106 in 3 hr and 6 hr incubation periods. In conclusion, curcumin or Vit. E surpplementation alone or cooperatively improved sperm viability index (motility, membrane intergrity, viability and survival rates) and fertility index (mitochondria activity, acrosome intergrity and lipid peroxidation) of fresh boar sperm, indicating that curcumin and Vit. E have a antioxidative properties through its scavenging activity against hydrogen peroxide."

In vitro에서는 지방원료로서 tallow(T), 그리고 tallow에 2가 양이온은 MgO (T-Mg), CaCl2(T-Ca), MgO와 CaCl2의 혼합 (T-MgCa) 및 Ca-salt 처리 tallow(T-CaS)의 총 5개의 처리구를 두었다. In vitro 배양 시간은 0, 6, 12, 및 24 hr별로 두었다. In vivo 사양 실험은 in vitro 실험을 통하여 얻은 결과를 토대로 성적이 좋은 T-MgCa 구와 T-CaS 구를 선택하여 지방 무첨가구를 대조구로 하여 비육후기 한우의 성장률 및 육질에 미치는 영향을 관찰하고자 처리구당 10두씩 3 처리구로 완전임의 배치하여 80일간 실시하였다. 실험결과를 살펴보면 배양시간 6 hr 이후부터 처리구들간 변화를 보였는데 6 hr에서는 T-MgCa 구와 T-CaS 구에서의 pH 값이 다른 처리구들의 값보다 높게 조사되었고(P<0.05), 12 hr에서는 T와 T-Mg 구에서의 pH 값이 MgO와 CaCl2 첨가구 보다 높게 조사되었다(P<0.05). Ammonia-N의 농도는 6 hr를 제외하고는 처리구들간 통계적 유의차이는 없었다. 6 hr에서의 ammonia-N 농도는 tallow 단독 처리구에서의 농도가 다른 처리구들보다 낮았다(P<0.05). 총 VFA 생성량은 6 hr에서는 처리구들간 통계적 유의차이가 없었지만 12 hr와 24 hr에서는 T 처리구에 비하여 tallow에 2가 양이온 첨가 또는 Ca-salt를 혼합 첨가한 처리구들에서 높게 조사되었다(P<0.05). 영양소(DM, OM, CP 및 NDF)분해율은 12 hr 이후부터 tallow 단독 처리구보다 양이온이나 Ca-salt 처리 tallow 구에서 보다 높은 경향을 보였다. 용해성 지방산은 전 배양 시간대에 걸쳐 T-CaS 구에서 가장 낮았으나, 불용성 지방산 염 형성은 가장 높았다(P<0.05). 사료급여 30일까지(feeding period I)는 사료섭취량, 일당증체량 및 사료 이용효율이 처리구들간 통계적 유의차이가 없었다. 반면에, feeding period II(31～50일)와 III(51～80일) 그리고, 전 급여기간 동안 일당 증체량과 사료이용효율은 T-MgCa>T-CaS>Control순으로 높았다(P<0.05). 결론적으로 사료 섭취량의 증가가 제한되는 비거세 한우의 비육 마무리기에 있어서 고 에너지 사료제조를 위한 우지의 첨가시 Ca 및 Mg 보충은 반추위 발효성상 및 성장성적의 개선효과가 있음이 확인되었다.This study was aimed at investigating the effect of fat supplementation with divalent ions such as MgO and CaCl2 on 1) in vitro ruminal fermentation characteristics and insoluble fatty acid formation, and on 2) animal performance in finishing Hanwoo bulls. In in vitro trial, five different types of diets based on supplementation sources of fat and divalent ions, i.e. T=basal diet+4% tallow, T-Ca=T+0.5% CaCl2, T-Mg=TA+0.5% MgO, T-MgCa= T+0.5% CaCl2+0.5% MgO, T-CaS=4% Ca salt tallow, were tested. Higher pH values were observed at 6 hr incubation(P<0.01) while higher amount of VFA were produced in diets 4 and 5 at 12 hr incubation(P<0.05). Nutrients(DM, OM, Crude protein and NDF) degradation tended to increase in divalent ions or Ca-salts treated tallow treatments compared with tallow treatment after 12 h. The amount of insoluble fatty acid increased by adding MgO or CaCl2 to tallow or Ca soap tallow during incubation(P<0.05). In in vivo trial, thirty finishing Hanwoo(average BW 460kg) were divided into three groups based on fat sources and divalent ions, i.e. Control(EE 2.40), T-MgCa=control+tallow+CaCl2+MgO, T-CaS=control+Ca soap tallow (EE 5.30%). After feeding each diet for 80 days, average daily weight gain showed 0.89, 1.02, 1.17kg in diets 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The highest feed efficiency was observed(0.12) in diet 2 group, followed by diet 3 (0.10) and 1 groups(0.08; P<0.05). In conclusion, the present results could be summarized that the performance of Hanwoo bulls was improved by tallow with divalent ions without any negative effect on rumen fermentation.Tallow, CaCl2, MgO, Ca-salt tallow, In vitro fermentation, Hanwoo"
694,일회성 운동이 골격근의 UCP3 mRNA 발현에 미치는 영향,윤혜연 /Hea-Yeon Yun,2006,한국운동영양학회,"PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of acute exercise training on uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) mRNA levels, uncoupling the respiratory chain and producing heat, of skeletal muscle in rat. METHODS. Treadmill running: Sixty-four Male Sprague-Dawley rats (5 wk) were divided into control (CON) and exercise (EX), recovery group (EX-Rest). The rats of CON were sacrificed at 0 min, 60 min and 24 hr. The rats of EX were sacrificed at 0min, 15min, 30min and 60min during treadmill running exercise. The rats of EX-Rest were sacrificed at 0min, 1hr, 3hr, 6hr and 24hr of recovery from 1hr treadmill running exercise. Analysis: Analysis of UCP3 mRNA expression was used by Real-time PCR. RESULTS. UCP3 mRNA levels of CON group were no changed according to time course. However, UCP3 mRNA of EX group was decreased during exercise, and peaked at 1 hr post-exercise, had returned to basal levels within 24 hr. The acute exercise effect on UCP3 mRNA expression appeared at 1 hr after exercise. CONCLUSION. Thus, it may be rational that UCP3 mRNA is up-regulation when a large amount of glucose and/or fatty acids influx occurs in skeletal muscles. UCP3 might have a role for fine adjustments of energy expenditure."

The subjects were 257 elderly Korean women (mean age 69.32 years). Body composition measurement items were minerals, muscle mass(MM), fat mass(FM), body fat percentage(BFP), waist-hip ratio(WHR) and body mass index(BMI). Hemodynamic factors were systolic blood pressure(SBP), diastolic blood pressure(DBP), resting heart rate(HR), pulse wave korotkoff sound systolic time(TP-KS), pressure rate product(PRP), stroke volume(SV), cardiac output(CO), cardiac index(CI) and total peripheral resistance(TPR). Data assessment for Pearson’s correlations and common factors was analyzed using SPSS (ver. 19.0). The results are as follows.
First, there was no significant correlations between body compositions and hemodynamic variables in elderly Korean women.
Second, MM and WHR were significantly related to all of body compositions. There were statistically significant positive relationships between MM and obesity.
Third, hemodynamic variables such as SBP, HR, PRP, CO were TPR modulators which affect blood circulations throughout whole-body.
Fourth, arteriosclerosis index(TP-KS) displayed a negative relationship with HR, however there were no any significant correlations between TP-KS, body compositions and hemodynamic variables.
Fifth, measuring body compositions and hemodynamic items such as FM, minerals, CO, DBP, HR can be used to help figure out most of the body composition and hemodynamic conditions in elderly Korean women.
In summary, the relationships between body compositions and hemodynamic variables were no significance, which suggests that the body compositions and hemodynamic elements in elderly Korean women should be interpreted and took care of as a independent factor for elderly health management. Controling muscle mass and abdominal obesity would be helpful for managing all of body composition and elderly health. Mild obesity in elderly Korean women may have positive effects on keeping muscle mass and expanding lifespan. Senile arteriosclerosis may be more affected by other components than body compositions and hemodynamic variables."
696,Hemoglobin Concentration and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Korean Men and Women - The Korean Heart Study,김무영 /Moo-Young Kim,2013,대한의학회,"This study investigated the relationship between hemoglobin concentration and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). A total of 407,858 subjects (256,851 men, aged 30-94 yr), who underwent physical examination at 17 Korean nationwide health examination centers, was included in this study. Data regarding CVD incidence were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance database. In Cox proportional hazard models, men with lower or higher hemoglobin level showed higher hazard ratios (HR) with total CVD (HR, 1.14; 95% Confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.21 for the 1st quintile; HR,1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.21 for the 5th quintile), ischemic heart disease (HR, 1.16; 95% CI,1.07-1.26 for the 1st quintile; HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.25 for the 5th quintile), and stroke (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.25 for the 1st quintile; HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.30 for the 5th quintile) compared to those with mid-level of hemoglobin (3rd quintile). Women with higher hemoglobin level showed higher HR with total CVD (HR, 1.15; 95% CI,1.01-1.31 for pre-menopausal women; HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16 for postmenopausal women).

697,The Effect of Bortezomib on Expression of Inflammatory Cytokines and Survival in a Murine Sepsis Model Induced by Cecal Ligation and Puncture,김준명 /June-Myung Kim,2015,연세대학교의과대학,"Purpose: Although the proteasome inhibitor known as bortezomib can modulate the inflammatory process through the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway, the immunomodulatoryeffect of pre-incubated bortezomib has not been fully evaluated for inflammation by infectious agents. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of bortezomib on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and mediators in macrophage cell lines and on survival in a murine peritonitis sepsis model. Materials and Methods: Bortezomibwas applied 1 hr before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in RAW 264.7 cells. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) experiments were performed in C57BL/6J mice. Results: Pre-incubation with bortezomib (25 nM or 50 nM) prior to LPS (50 ng/mL or 100 ng/mL) stimulation significantly recovered the number of viable RAW 264.7 cells compared to those samples without pre-incubation. Bortezomibdecreased various inflammatory cytokines as well as nitric oxide production in LPS-stimulated cells. The 7-day survival rate in mice that had received bortezomib at 0.01 mg/kg concentration 1 hr prior to CLP was significantly higher than in the mice that had only received a normal saline solution of 1 mL 1 hr prior to CLP. In addition, the administration of bortezomib at 0.01 mg/kg concentration 1 hr before CLP resulted in a significant decrease in inflammation of the lung parenchyma. Collectively,pretreatment with bortezomib showed an increase in the survival rate and changes in the levels of inflammatory mediators. Conclusion: These results support the possibility of pretreatment with bortezomib as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of overwhelming inflammation, which is a characteristic of severe sepsis."

We then described the SVMs of Pacific oyster exposed to the toxic algae under laboratory conditions. Pacific oyster used for experiment were fed Isochrysis galbana until they stabilized and kept under hunger conditions for three days to prevent the influence of food before the experiment. Pacific oyster were exposed to the toxic dinoflagellate, A. fundyense, and the potentially toxic dinoflagellate, A. affine. When Pacific oyster were exposed to A. fundyense, SVMs increased over 10 times/hr at low cell densities of 20 cells/mL. SVMs increased again at 14.1 ± 5.7 times/hr at 500 cells/mL, and 27.9 ± 11.1 times/hr at the high cell density of 5,000 cells/mL. However, in the presence of A. affine, SVMs increased at 6.7 ± 3.9 times/hr until 300 cells/mL, while they increased greatly to 15.3 ± 10.8 times/hr at 1,000 cells/mL. The SVMs of Pacific oyster indicated differences depending on species for toxic dinoflagellates. Therefore, the SVMs of Pacific oyster could be useful for A. fundyense, but would bedifficult to apply for A. affine."

We investigated whether physical activity levels or SB were related to percent body fat (%BF) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods: In this cross sectional study, we measured the duration of SB, light physical activity (LPA), moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), total energy expenditure, and step counts using a wireless activity tracker (Fitbit HR; FB) for 7 days in freeliving conditions, along with %BF using a bio impedance analyzer (Inbody; Biospace) in 120 smartphone users with T2DM. Subjects were divided into exercise (Exe, n=68) and non-exercise (nonExe, n=52) groups based on self-reports of whether the recommended exercises (30 min/day, 3 days/week for 3 months) were performed. SBt, LPAt, MVPAt were transformed from SB, LPA, MVPA for normally distributed variables.
Results: Participants were: female, 59.2%; age, 59.3±8.4 years; body mass index, 25.5±3.4 kg/m2; glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 7.6%±1.2%; %BF, 30.4%±7.1%. They performed SB for 15.7±3.7 hr/day, LPA for 4.4±1.7 hr/day, and MVPA for 0.9±0.8 hr/day. The %BF was related to SBt and LPAt, but not to MVPA after adjustments for age, gender, and HbA1c. VPA was significantly higher in the Exe group than in the nonExe group, but SB, LPA, and moderate physical activity were not different.
Predicted %BF was 89.494 to 0.105 (age), –13.047 (gender), –0.507 (HbA1c), –7.655 (LPAt) (F[4, 64]=62.929, P<0.001), with an R2 of 0.785 in multiple linear regression analysis.
Conclusion: Reduced body fat in elderly diabetic patients might be associated with reduced inactivity and increased LPA."

I place importance on the computation of tunnel intervals according to the speed variations. there's a summary of the results.
The results of the study reveal that speed changes occur both on 1km ahead of tunnel and within the tunnel. The speed change amounts to 7.1km/hr(6.9%) on these survey points 2.7km/hr (2.9%) on access points, and from -3.6km/hr (-3.8%) to, +4.1km/hr(+4.7%) irregularly on egress points.
The magnitude of speed change appears small on the survey points where an interval of tunnel is short whereas the speed change turn out to be rather significant on the points where the tunnel interval is long.
The analysis of tunnel distances using multiple regression models shows that the appropriate tunnel distance turns out to be 732m. The distance of 732m seem to be providing a foundation for uniform traffic flow in continuous tunnel conditions.This thesis is based on the speed variations which are observed both in a single tunnel and a continuous tunnel.

The model flume and the rainfall simulator were designed and produced. The model flume was designed in consideration of the landslide characteristics of Korea. The landslides in Korea were mainly occurred in the interface between soil layer and rock layer. The rainfall simulator was produced for controlling hourly rainfall ranged from 100 mm/hr to 1,000 mm/hr. Jumnunjin standard sand as slope soils was placed on the model flume. The model experiments were performed with changing the hourly rainfall ranged from 150 mm/hr to 250 mm/hr. In this experiments, the inclination of slope was 25o and the relative density of slope soils was 35%. As a result of experiments, the pore water pressure is rapidly increased at landslide occurring time, and the scale of landslide is increased with increasing in hourly rainfall. The spreading range of run out distance is occurred with pan type, and the spreading width and length are rapidly increased in its early stage and slowly increased after early stage. The increasing velocity of runout distance of debris is influenced by hourly rainfall, and the spreading area is influenced by both hourly rainfall and during time. The simple method to estimate debris volume and runout distance was proposed using the apparent coefficient of friction and the location of tension crack.landslide, model test, rainfall, runout distance, pore water pressure, tension crack"
703,"Analysis of Membrane Integrity, DNA Fragmentation and Mitochondrial Function in Pig Spermatozoa Sorted by Flowcytometer",In Cheul Kim,2008,사단법인 한국동물생명공학회,"The objective of this study was to determine the potential hazardous effects of sorting process by flowcytometry on the quality of boar spermatozoa by flowcytometer. Freshly collected boar semen was diluted and divided into two groups; control none sorted and sorted. Sperms in sorted group were processed with flowcytometer for cell sorting with 100 μM nozzle under the 20 psi pressure. Measurements on each parameter were made at two time points, 0 hr (right after sorting) and 24 hr post sorting. Although there was a tendency of lower viability in sorted group than none sorted control group, the percentage of live cells in control (75.83±6.92 & 59.53±10.34) was not significantly different from sorted (59.70±7.37 & 43.97±3.76) at both 0 and 24 hr post sorting. However, sorted sperm showed significantly lower mitochondrial function compared to the control at both 0 h (79.37±3.22 vs. 63.50±10.05) and 24 hr (67.27±3.22 vs. 46.97±5.37) time points (p<0.007). Sperm DNA fragmentation rate was significantly lower in control (22.0±7.04) than that of sorted (32.27±7.49) at 24 hr time point (p<0.0002). Taken together, these data suggested that sorting process by flowcytometer may have influenced sperm motility rather than viability. Also high speed sperm sorting by flowcytometer has significant effects on DNA fragmentation on elapsed time after sorting."

Packing ratios of BCM to BCM-ASR systems 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 0% (suspended growth only), 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively. All systems were operated at an HRT of 4 hr, 6 hr, and 8 hr, respectively; DO concentration was maintained 0.5~1.0 mg/L and 1.5~2.0 mg/L for each HRT condition. In terms of TSS, TCODcr and SCODcr removal efficiency, all systems had a similar level of the removal efficiency under varied HRTs, and DO. But organic removal efficiency of systems with BCM was approximately 3~5% higher than systems without BCM at the same HRT and the DO. About the nitrification efficiency, with high DO (1.5~2.0 mg/L), as HRT (4 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr) or BCM packing ratio increased, the slight increment of nitrification efficiency was observed. However, under the low DO (0.5~1.0 mg/L), increase of BCM packing ratio and HRT resulted in large increase of the nitrification efficiency. At the same HRT and BCM packing ratio, the nitrification efficiency increased greatly with up to 15% as DO increased. When the HRT increased from 4hr to 8hr, the denitrification efficiency slightly increased by 5~10% only, under all DO conditions. Systems with BCM had higher denitrification efficiency, ranged 62.7~91.1% than systems without BCM showed 32.1~65.6%. And the increase in BCM packing ratio from 10% to 20% resulted in about 14~16% denitrification efficiency increment. BCM packing ratio showed great effect on the denitrification. The increase of the DO (from 0.5~1.0 mg/L to 1.5~2.0 mg/L) at the same HRT and BCM packing ratio resulted in slight decrease of denitrification efficiency with up to 7% for systems with BCM. But for systems without BCM, the denitrification efficiency decreased with up to 28%. In all system, the denitrification efficiency had more influence on the TN removal efficiency than nitrification efficiency. So, BCM packing ratio (0%, 10%, 15%, 20%) has greater effect on the TN removal than HRT and DO. The TN removal efficiency increased as packing ratio of BCM increased with up to 45%. As a result, the highest TN removal efficiency was observed 73.7% at the condition showed the highest denitrification efficiency that DO of 0.5~1.0 mg/L, an HRT of 8 hr, and 20% of BCM packing ratio was maintained."
705,Comparison of Microtubule Distributions between Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer and Parthenogenetic Porcine Embryos,박주희,2009,사단법인 한국동물생명공학회,"The aim of this study was to examine the microtubule distributions of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and parthenogenetic porcine embryos. Porcine SCNT embryos were produced by fusion of serum-starved fetal fibroblast cells with enucleated oocytes. Reconstituted and mature oocytes were activated by electric pulses combined with 6-dimethlyaminopurine treatment. SCNT and parthenogenetic embryos were cultured in vitro for 6 days. Microtubule assembly of embryos was examined by confocal microscopy 1 hr and 20 hr after fusion or activation, respectively. The proportions of embryos developed to the blastocyst stage were 25.7% and 30.4% in SCNT and parthenogenetic embryos, respectively. The frequency of embryos showing β-tubulins was 81.8% in parthenogenetic embryos, whereas 31.3% in SCNT embryos 1 hr after activation or fusion. The frequency of the embryos underwent normal mitotic phase was low in SCNT embryos (40.6%) compared to that of parthenogenetic ones (59.7%) 20 hr after fusion or activation (p<0.05). The rate of SCNT embryos with an abnormal mitosis pattern is about twice compared to that of parthenogenetic ones. The spindle assembly and its distribution of SCNT embryos in the first mitotic phase were not different from those of parthenogenetic ones. The result shows that although microtubule distribution of porcine SCNT embryos shortly after fusion is different from parthenogenetic embryos, and the frequency of abnormal mitosis 20 hr after fusion or activation is slightly increased in SCNT embryos, microtubule distributions at the first mitotic phase are similar in both SCNT and parthenogenetic embryos."
706,Preoperative Aspirin Resistance does not Increase Myocardial Injury during Off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery,김현주,2011,대한의학회,"We performed a prospective cohort trial on 220 patients undergoing elective off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery and taking aspirin to evaluate the effect of aspirin resistance on myocardial injury. The patients were divided into aspirin responders and aspirin nonresponders by the value of the aspirin reaction units obtained preoperatively using the VerifyNowTM Aspirin Assay. The serum levels of troponin I were measured before surgery and 1, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after surgery. In-hospital major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, graft occlusion, the postoperative blood loss and reexploration for bleeding were recorded. Of the 220 patients, 181 aspirin responders (82.3%) and 39 aspirin non-responders (17.7%) were defined. There were no significant differences in troponin I levels (ng/mL) between aspirin responders and aspirin non-responders: preoperative (0.04 ±0.08 vs 0.03 ± 0.06; P = 0.56), postoperative 1 hr (0.72 ± 0.87 vs 0.86 ± 1.10; P = 0.54),6 hr (2.92 ± 8.76 vs 1.50 ± 2.40; P = 0.94), 24 hr (4.16 ± 13.44 vs 1.25 ± 1.95; P = 0.52),48 hr (2.15 ± 7.06 vs 0.65 ± 0.95; P = 0.64) and 72 hr (1.20 ± 4.63 vs 0.38 ± 0.56; P =0.47). Moreover, no significant differences were observed with regard to in-hospital outcomes. In conclusion, preoperative aspirin resistance does not increase myocardial injury in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. Postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy might have protected aspirin resistant patients."

Co., Busan, Korea) and reference (Jenapharm Hydrocortisone 10 mg, JayTech Biogen, Seoul, Korea) hydrocortisone tablets. Twenty-four healthy male Korean volunteers were divided into two groups with a randomized 2 ´ 2 cross-over design. In order to suppress the endogenous cortisol secretion, a single oral dose of Dexamethasone (4 mg) was administered 10 hr prior to hydrocortisone administration. Blood samples were withdrawn for 10 hr at the predetermined intervals after a single oral dose of hydrocortisone (20 mg). The serum concentration of hydrocortisone was analyzed by HPLC/UV using a column switching method after liquid-liquid extraction process. The pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0~10hr, Cmax, and Tmax) of the test and reference hydrocortisone tablets were determined while the secretion of endogenous cortisol was being suppressed. The pharmacokinetic parameters of the test tablet were not statistically different from those of the reference tablet at a value was 0.05. The 90% confidence intervals for the average ratio (test/reference) of AUC0~10hr and Cmax were within the Korea Food and Drug Administration acceptance range of 0.80-1.25 (0.89~ 0.99 and 0.86~0.99 for AUC0~10hr and Cmax, respectively). Therefore it was concluded that the test tablet, Daewoo Hydrocortisone tablet was bioequivalent to the reference tablet, Jenapharm Hydrocortisone tablet."

In vitro 반추위 배양액의 pH는 6.46~6.89 수준으로서 시간이 경과함에 따라 감소하는 경향이었다. 총 가스발생량은 감초, 산초, 계피, 결명자 처리구 순으로 감초 추출물 첨가구에서 가장 많았으며, 모든 한약재 추출물 첨가구가 대조구에 비해 유의적(p<0.05)으로 많았다. 메탄생성 비율은 3시간 발효 시, 감초 추출물 처리구가 타 처리구에 비해 낮았으나 시간이 경과함에 따라 비율이 오히려 높아졌으며, 한약재 추출물 첨가구가 대조구에 비해 유의적으로 높았다(p<0.05). 수소가스의 생성비율은 6시간 발효 시까지는 처리구간에 차이가 없었으나 12시간 발효 시에는 한약재 추출물 첨가구가 대조구에 비해 유의적(p<0.05)으로 높게 나타났다. 암모니아 생성량은 발효 3시간대에는 산초 추출물 첨가구와 감초추출물 첨가구가 대조구에 비해 높았으나, 발효 12시간대에는 감초 추출물 첨가구가 대조구에 비해 유의적으로 낮았다(p<0.05). 이상의 결과에서 본 시험에 사용된 한약재 추출물은 가스 생성량을 비롯한 메탄 생성량을 증가시키고, 메탄 발효를 촉진시키는 것으로 나타났다.This study was conducted to investigate the effects of several herbal extracts (obtusifolia, cinnamon, chinese pepper, licorice root) on the characteristics of rumen fermentation in vitro. Soybean meal was used as a substrate for fermentation in vitro. Herbal extracts were supplemented to media by 10% of the substrate. The substrates supplemented to Dehority artificial media with herbal extracts were fermented in 30ml serum bottles for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 hr at 39℃. Cumulative gas production was significantly (p<0.05) greater in the herbal extract supplements than in the control, in the order of licorice root, chinese pepper, cinnamon and obtusifolia. Methane proportions of the herbal extracts were significantly (p<0.05) higher than that of the control. Licorice root extract supplementation resulted in the lowest methane proportion at 3 hr fermentation. Proportion of hydrogen was significantly (p<0.05) higher in the herbal extract supplements than in the control at 12 hr fermentation. Compared to the control, ammonia concentration in the licorice root was significantly higher at 3 hr fermentation, but lower at 12 hr fermentation (p<0.05). Based on these results, supplementation of the herbal extracts used in this experiment resulted in increased cumulative gas production and stimulating methane production in vitro rumen fermentation."

MLCV와 APCV는 80km/hr와 100km/hr 주행 시 Driving only에 비해 Driving + Sending Text Message(STM)와 Driving + Searching Navigation(SN)에서 유의하게 증가하였다. JC 또한 주행 시 Driving only에 비해 Driving + STM과 Driving + SN에서 증가하였다. 본 연구를 통해 운전 경력이 길고 운전 전문가라고 할 수 있는 50대 택시 운전자도 운전만을 수행하는 경우에 비해 운전과 함께 문자 메시지 전송 또는 네비게이션 검색 과제를 수행하게 될 경우 동작 패턴이 거칠어지고 차량 통제가 어려워진다는 사실을 도출할 수 있었다.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of secondary task such as sending text message (STM) and searching navigation (SN) using the variable indicating control of vehicle ((Medial-Lateral Coefficient of Variation, MLCV), (Anterior-Posterior Coefficient of Variation, APCV)) and motion signal (Jerk-Cost function, JC). Participants included 50s taxi drivers; 14 males and 14 females. Participants were instructed to keep a certain distance (30m) from the car ahead with constant speed (80km/hr or 100km/hr). Experiement consisted of driving alone for 1minute and driving with secondary task for 1minute. Both MLCV and APCV were significantly increased during Driving + Sending Text Message(STM) and Driving + Searching Navigation(SN) than Driving only. Also, JC was increased during Driving + STM and Driving + SN than Driving only. In this study, we found that even in the experts group who are taxi driver and have 25 years driving experience, the smoothness of motion is decreased and the control of vehicle is disturbed when they were performing secondary tasks like sending text message or searching navigation.secondary task, driving performance, motion analysis, driving simulator, 50s taxi drivers"

Of 2,732 na- sal swabs tested, MRSA was detected in 829 (85.6%) and 140 (14.4%) swabs after 1 and 2 days of incubation, respectively, and the median reporting times for positive specimens were 33.7 hr (range, 18.2-156.9 hr) and 108.1 hr (range, 69.8-181.0 hr), respectively. De- tection rate after 1-day incubation was 85%. Additional 1-day incubation improved detec- tion rate; however, it prolonged the reporting times of positive specimens approximately up to 4 days because of the need for confirmatory tests such as species identification and sus- ceptibility tests. Following a 2-day culture with ChromID MRSA, rapid confirmatory tests are warranted to reduce delay in identifying MRSA carriers."

And several quantitative quality measures (ME, BS, RRBC, NSD, NSE and MSE) were used to examine the spatial and temporal resolution. As a result, RRBC and MSE among the measures well assessed the bias and the variability, respectively. When the radar bin size was 250 m, RRBC decreased from -58.4% (accumulation time of 10 min) to -41.6% (accumulation time of 360 min) as the accumulation time increased. And MSE also decreased from 5.5 mm 2 /hr 2 (accumulation time of 10 min) to 0.4 mm 2 /hr 2 (accumulation time of 360 min). When the accumulation time was 10min, RRBC negatively increased from -58.4% (radar bin size of 250 m) to -63.2% (radar bin size of 1,000 m) as the radar bin size increased. And MSE decreased 5.5 mm 2 /hr 2 (radar bin size of 250 m) to 3.0 mm 2 /hr 2 (radar bin size of 1,000 m). The correlation coefficient between the radar rain rate and gauge rain rate increased as the accumulation time and the radar bin size increased. The correlation coefficient at 30 min of accumulation time was 0.8 and it increased by nearly 30% compared to 10 min of accumulation time. The correlation coefficient with 1,000 m of radar grid size was 0.63 and it slightly increased by nearly 1.8% compared to 250 m of radar grid size. From this, it has found that the correlation coefficient was more sensitive to the temporal resolution than the spatial resolution.Radar rainfall, Gauge rainfall, RRBC, MSE, Correlation coefficient"
713,"Comparison of Analytical and Clinical Performance of HPV 9G DNA Chip, PANArray HPV Genotyping Chip, and Hybrid-Capture II Assay in Cervicovaginal Swabs",Ho Young Jung,2016,대한병리학회,"Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can be detected by using several molecular methods, including Hybrid-Capture II (HC2) assay and variable HPV DNA chip tests, although each method has different sensitivities and specificities. Methods: We performed HPV 9G DNA Chip (9G) and PANArray HPV Genotyping Chip (PANArray) tests on 118 cervicovaginal swabs and compared the results with HC2, cytology, histology, and direct sequencing results. Results: The overall and high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) positivity rates were 62.7% and 44.9% using 9G, and 61.0% and 30.5% using PANArray, respectively. The positivity rates for HR-HPV with these two chips were significantly lower than 55.1% when HC2 was used. The sensitivity of overall HPV positivity in detecting histologically confirmed low-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions or higher was 88.7% for all three tests. The specificity was 58.5% for 9G and 61.5% for PANArray, which was significantly lower than the 72.3% for HC2. With the HR-HPV+ genotype threshold, the sensitivity decreased to 75.5% for 9G and 52.8% for PANArray, which was significantly lower than the 88.7% for HC2. Comparison of the two chips showed concordant results in 55.1% of the samples, compatible results in 16.9%, and discordant results in 28.0%, exhibiting poor agreement in detecting certain HPV genotypes. Compared with direct sequencing, 9G yielded no discordant results, whereas PANArray yielded 31 discordant results (26.7%). Conclusions: Compared with HC2, the HPV genotyping tests showed lower sensitivity in histologic correlation. When the two chips were compared, the 9G was more sensitive and accurate for detecting HR-HPV than the PANArray."

We investigated the systemic factors significantly related to clinical outcome in relapsed/refractory DLBCL.MethodsIn 242 patients with DLBCL, several factors, including inflammatory markers were analyzed. We assessed for the correlation between the survivals [progression-free surviv-al (PFS) and overall survival (OS)] and prognostic factors. ResultsIn these patients, a high derived neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) (PFS, HR=2.452, P=0.002; OS, HR=2.542, P=0.005), high Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) (PFS, HR=2.435, P=0.002; OS, HR=2.621, P=0.002), and high NCCN-IPI (PFS, HR=2.836, P=0.003; OS, HR=2.928, P=0.003) were significantly associated with survival in multi-variate analysis. Moreover, we proposed a risk stratification model based on dNLR, GPS, and NCCN-IPI, thereby distributing patients into 4 risk groups. There were significant differences in survival among the 4 risk groups (PFS, P＜0.001; OS, P＜0.001). ConclusionIn conclusion, dNLR, GPS, and NCCN-IPI appear to be excellent prognostic parameters for survival in relapsed/refractory DLBCL."
715,Relative Survival Benefit by Hormonal Receptor Status of Adding Trastuzumab to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients,Jean Schneider,2020,한국유방암학회,"Purpose: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) involving trastuzumab markedly increases pathologic complete response (pCR) rates in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. Despite increasing pCR rates, long-term survival gains are controversial owing to distinctive biologic behavior mediated by the presence of hormonal receptors (HRs) that may interact with HER2 receptors. We, therefore, investigated the differences in relative survival gain provided by neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy on HR positive (HR+) status of patients.
Methods: We retrospectively ana Patient clinical characteristics were compared usin lyzed women with stage II or III HER2+ breast cancer who underwent NAC followed by a breast cancer surgery between 2008 and 2013. The survival benefits of adding trastuzumab to NAC were analyzed by classifying patients into HR+ and HR negative (HR−) groups.
Results: Of 666 patients included in the study, 374 (52.1%) were HR+ and 319 (47.9%) were HR−. In the HR+ group, trastuzumab treatment led to higher pCR rates and significantly better breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) than no trastuzumab treatment. However, among patients with HR− breast cancer, trastuzumab treatment showed no statistically significant difference between BCSS and OS following multivariate analysis.
Conclusion: We found that the addition of trastuzumab to NAC improved relative survival benefit in HER2+/HR+ patients than in HER2+/HR− patients, even though the pCR rate increases were lower. Although pCR has been regarded as a surrogate marker for estimating long-term survival benefits after NAC, it alone may not translate into real long-term oncologic outcomes in particular cancer subtypes after trastuzumab-based NAC. Further longer-term evaluation of the objective survival benefit after NAC driven by a dual HER2 block according to HR status is warranted."

Chemical transformation from ginseng saponin glycosides to prosapogenin was analyzed by the HPLC. Extracts of ginseng (Panax ginseng) berry was processed under several treatment conditions including ultrasonication treatments. The content of total saponin reached their heights at 6 hr (UGB-6, 61.760%) of ultrasonication treatment, followed by 10 hr (UGB-10, 53.009%) and 9 hr (UGB-9, 50.652%) of ultrasonication treatment at 100oC. Results of those treatments showed that the quantity of ginsenoside Rh1 increased by over 15% at 10 hr of ultrasonication treatment at 100oC. The results of processing with UGB-10 indicate that the ultrasonication processed ginseng berry extracts that had gone through 10 hr treatments were found to contain the largest amount of ginsenoside Rh1 (15.358%), Rg2 (6.301%), Re (4.567%) and F4 (2.658%). In addition, UGB-6 contained ginsenoside Rg3 (13.632%) at high concentrations. It is thought that such results provide basic information in preparing ginseng berry extracts with functionality enhanced."

719,Impact of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and/or Prostatitis on the Risk of Prostate Cancer in Korean Patients,Kim Sung Han,2021,대한남성과학회,"Purpose: We evaluated the impact of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis on the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in patients using nationally representative data of the Korean population from the National Health Insurance Service.
Materials and Methods: A total of 5,580,495 Korean men, aged >20 years, who had undergone health screening in 2009 were followed-up for 9 years until 2017. Multivariate adjusted Cox regression analysis was conducted to determine the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between BPH and/or prostatitis and PCa. The HR for PCa according to the presence of BPH and/or prostatitis was stratified by a combination of BPH and prostatitis in multivariableadjusted models.
Results: The HR for PCa significantly increased in patients with BPH and prostatitis than in patients without BPH and prostatitis (adjusted HR, 1.626; 95% CI, 1.567–1.688 and adjusted HR, 1.557; 95% CI, 1.500–1.618, respectively). In particular, for the combination of BPH and prostatitis, the adjusted HR was 1.856 (95% CI, 1.743–1.976), which was the highest when a diagnosis of both BPH and prostatitis was made.
Conclusions: BPH and/or prostatitis are associated with an increased incidence for PCa in Korean patients, which is likely associated with similar effects to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, so care must be taken in the interpretation. However, if follow-up survival studies demonstrate differences between the two groups (BPH and prostatitis vs. general), it could be one of the evidence for the introduction of PSA screening in Korea."
720,Changing Perspectives of Managing Human Resources in Nepal,드루바 쿠마르 고탐 /Dhruba Kumar Gautam,2012,강원대학교 경영경제연구소,"Sustainable competitive advantage depends on formulationand implementation of appropriate human resourcemanagement (HRM) strategies and deployment oftheir competencies effectively in dynamic and complexenvironment. Competencies deployment is an approach tomake decisions on the intentions and plans of organizationconcerning employment relationship and its recruitment,training, development, performance appraisal, reward andemployee relations policies and practice. The improvementof organizational effectiveness is an overall objective ofpeople management in organizations. In light of these, thisstudy explores the present practices of HRM like: HR departments,HR policies and strategies, HR planning, recruitmentselection and placement, training and development,performance appraisal, compensation and benefit, employeerelations and communications. Based on the survey in 204Nepalese organizations as a unit of analysis, the study concludesthat HR practices in few organizations have actionprogram for minorities, ethnic group, older employees andpeople with disabilities. Due to centralized organizationalstructure, most of HR decisions are taken into central officeand line managers being involved highly in planning andimplementing HR policies. In a nutshell, though HRM practicesare not developed like developed countries, Nepaleseorganizations are realizing the significance of people managementat work and changing their practices in the presentdynamic environment."

722,Effects of Pre-analytical Variables on Cell-free DNA Extraction for Liquid Biopsy,정태동 /Tae-Dong Jeong,2019,대한진단검사의학회,"Background: Extraction of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a key step for determining the quality of cfDNA-related molecular diagnostics. We evaluated the effect of sample containers and sample storage conditions on cfDNA extraction.
Methods: The cfDNA extraction using the MagMAX Cell-Free DNA Isolation Kit from five healthy controls and five lung cancer patients was evaluated according to the type of sample container and storage conditions: K2-EDTA container, <1, 6, 24, and 48 hr storage at 4˚C after immediate plasma separation; and Cell-Free DNA BCT container, <1, 3, 7, and 14 days stored at room temperature. Mutation analysis of EGFR exons 18–21 was performed. To assess the effect of a delay in centrifugation, EDTA whole blood samples from five healthy individuals were stored at 4˚C for 6, 12, and 24 hr before plasma separation.
Results: There was no significant difference in the amount and nucleic acid size of cfDNA in both controls and patients with cancer when EDTA plasma was stored at 4˚C up to 48 hr. The amount and size of cfDNA in the BCT container were not different up to 7 days; however, the 14-day sample showed an increase in cfDNA concentration due to genomic DNA contamination. EGFR mutations were detected on EDTA containers up to 48 hr and with BCT containers up to 14 days. When EDTA whole blood was stored at 4˚C and plasma separation was delayed, the cfDNA concentration increased from 24 hr.
Conclusions: The cfDNA extraction was affected by the sample containers and storage conditions.배경: 세포유리 DNA (cell-free DNA, cfDNA) 추출 과정은 cfDNA와 연관된 분자진단 검사의 질을 결정하는 중요한 단계이다. 저자들은 검체 용기 종류와 검체 보관 조건이 cfDNA 추출에 미치는 영향에 대해 평가하였다. 방법: 다섯 명의 건강인과 다섯 명의 폐암 환자를 대상으로 MagMAX Cell-Free DNA 추출 시약을 사용하여 cfDNA를 추출하였다. K2-EDTA 항응고제가 첨가된 검체 용기는 채혈 후 즉시 혈장을 분리하였고, 냉장 상태에서 <1, 6, 24, 48시간 동안 혈장을 보관한 후 cfDNA를 추출하였다. cfDNA 전용 검체 용기(Cell-Free DNA BCT) 는 채혈 후 <1, 3, 7, 14일 동안 실온에서 보관한 후 cfDNA를 추출 하였다. 폐암 환자에서 EGFR 유전자(엑손 18-21) 변이 여부를 검사 하였다. 혈장 분리 시간이 cfDNA 추출에 미치는 영향을 평가하기 위해 다섯 명의 건강인을 대상으로 K2-EDTA 전혈을 6, 12, 24시간 동안 냉장 보관한 후 혈장을 분리하여 cfDNA를 추출하였다. 결과: 건강인과 폐암 환자 모두 냉장 보관된 K2-EDTA 혈장 검체는 48시간까지 cfDNA 양과 핵산의 크기에 차이가 없었다. BCT 검체 용기는 건강인과 폐암 환자 모두 7일까지 cfDNA의 양과 핵산의 크기에 차이가 없었으나, 14일째에는 유전체 DNA의 오염으로 인해 cfDNA 양이 증가하였다. EGFR 유전자 변이는 냉장 보관된 K2EDTA 혈장 검체에서 48시간까지, 실온 보관된 BCT 검체 용기는 14일까지 검출되었다. 냉장 보관된 K2-EDTA 전혈 검체에서 24시간 이상 혈장 분리가 지연된 경우 cfDNA의 양이 증가하였다. 결론: cfDNA 추출 성능은 검체 용기 종류와 검체 보관 조건에 영향을 받을 수 있다."

There were a lot of reports about in vitro porcine embryo development, butthere was no report about the selection of high quality embryos. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effectof vitamin K1 (vit K1) on the development and survival rate of porcine in vitro fertilized embryos. When vit K1 wastreated for 24 hr at day 1 in vitro culture, blastocyst development rate in the control group (35.5 ± 3.2%) wassignificantly lower compared to 1.0 μM, 3.0 μM, or 6.0 μM groups (14.5 ± 4.3, 0.0, or 0.0%; p<0.05). The survivalrates of blastocysts at day 8 in 1.0 μM, 3.0 μM or 6.0 μM of vit K1 treated groups (22.2 ± 2.9, 0.0 or 0.0%) weresignificantly lower than that of the control group (31.8 ± 2.6%; p<0.05). We were added at 1.0 μM, 3.0 μM or 6.0μM vit K1 for different durations of time at day 1 in vitro culture. The development rate and survival rate in thegroup of 1.0 μM vit K1 for 6 hr was 26.5 ± 2.9% and 47.2 ± 2.8%, respectively, which were differed significantlyin the group of 12 hr (p<0.05). In the group of 3.0 μM vit K1, the blastocyst development in control group was 36.4± 3.1% but, the survival rate 41.7 ± 3.2% in the group of 3.0 hr was significantly higher than that of the controlgroup (p<0.05). In the group of 6.0 μM vit K1, the control group’s the blastocyst development was 32.0 ± 2.8% andthe 0.5 hr supplement group’s survival rates was 42.9 ± 1.8% higher than other groups. We added vit K1 at day 1,day 2, day 4 and day 6 of in vitro culture, on the based the results of supplemented concentration and duration. Inthe group of 1.0 μM 6.0 hr addition, the blastocyst development rate of day 4 and the survival rate of day 2 werethe highest in each group. In the groups of 3.0 μM 3.0 hr addition or 6.0 μM 0.5 hr addition, the blastocystdevelopment (59.5 ± 4.1% and 50.0 ± 3.6%) and survival rates (72.7 ± 5.4% and 79.2 ± 4.0%) on day 4 weresignificantly higher than that of control and other experiment groups (p<0.05). Meanwhile, the number of cells inblastocysts that produced by vit K1 supplementation was 53.4 ± 5.8, 49.4 ± 3.8 and 51.5 ± 4.5 respectively, whichwere significantly higher than that of 40.2 ± 2.3 in the control group (p<0.05). There was no difference of the numberof apoptotic cells between control and experiment groups. In addition, gene expression of survival blastocyst, the BaxmRNA expression was similar between the control and the experiment groups. However, Bcl-xL mRNA expression’sin the group of 6.0 μM 0.5 hr on day 4 was highest among control and experiment groups (p<0.05).

Body weight, head-body length, ear length, and hind-foot length were not statistically significant (p>0.05), but tail length was statistically significant in females compared to males (p=0.003). To examine the secondary sexual dimorphism characteristics of the collected T. triton, B_HR, T_HR, E_HR, and H_HR were calculated based on the head-body length, and only T_HR was statistically significant (p=0.003). Because of comparing male and female averages, among the 21 traits, the greatest length of skull (GLS; p=0.020) and occipitonasal length (ONL; p=0.014) were statistically significant and length of incisive foramen (LIF) was statistically significant, when the significance level was 90%. However, the other 18 traits did not show statistically significant differences between males and females (p>0.05). Other than GLS, ONL, interorbital breadth (IB), and breadth of occipital foramen (BOF), there was female-biased SSD. The results of this study are the analysis of external morphology and skull characteristics of T. triton in Jeju Island and will be used as basic data to understand the morphological characteristics of T. triton. In addition, the data can be used as a basic information to compare characteristics of T. triton, which is known as a single species, inhabited in China and Russia. The data will play an important role in biogeography and ecology research of T. triton, based on geographical conditions, climate effects, and habitat environment."

Experiment was performed twice using four species in each experiment. Non-plantation, one species, or two species condition was created in each mesocosm. We measured air quality, primarily PM2.5 and PM10 at the initial open mesocosms and 1hr later since mesocosms were closed. The dry weight of vegetation was measured at the 2nd experiment. The decreased amount of PM2.5 and PM10 was 13.7±1.3 and 13.2±1.3 ㎍・m-3・hr-1 in wetland condition and 15.0±1.4 and 13.8±1.5 ㎍・m-3・hr-1 in dryland condition, respectively. In 2nd experiment, the decreased amount of PM 2.5 and PM 10 in wetland condition was 13.7±1.3 and 9.2±1.5 ㎍・m-3・hr-1, 15.0±1.4 and 8.8±1.4 ㎍・m-3・hr-1 in dryland condition, respectively. Wetland showed higher removal effect due to its high productivity leading to more effective absorption of particulate matter. Furthermore, the aquatic characteristics of wetland system and high humidity helped purifying the air quality. This can be seen as another value of wetlands, which can be presented as one of the solutions to the problem of fine dust.Biomass, Fine dust, PM2.5, PM10, Wetland ecosystem"

At 0 hr, the control group had the highest cohesiveness value, but after 24 hr it presented the lowest value. For gumminess, after 6 hr of storage, the control group offered the lowest value. Whereas after 12 hr of storage the whole protein group showed the highest value, and at 24 hr, the whole protein, 7S protein, and 1S protein groups had higher values. According to the DSC results, the 1S protein group had lower enthalpy values(△H) suggesting that adding 11S protein to JP might improve starch retrogradation. After 72 hr of storage, the control group had the highest onset temperature(To) and peak tem-perature(Tp) whereas the 7S and 11S protein JP samples had higher conclusion temperatures(Tc). Therefore, based on the different analysis result between retrogradation."

A Korean and Japanese joint civil survey was conducted around Fukushima on April 13-17. The radiation survey data clearly shows a large hotspot area between 20 km and 50 km radius north and west direction from the accident reactors, with the highest radiation recorded being 55.64 μSv/hr in the air, 99.89 μSv/hr in the surface air, and 36.16 μSv/hr in a car, respectively. 3.65 μSv/hr in the air and 6.89 μSv/hr in the surface air were detected at the playground of an elementary school in Fukushima City. Spring came with full cherry blossoms in Fukushima, but it was silent spring of radiation contamination. Interviews with Fukushima nuclear refugees reveal serious problems about Japanese nuclear safety systems, such as there was no practical evacuation drill within 1-10 km and no plan at all for 10-30 km areas. Several reforms items for Korean nuclear safety system can be suggested: minimization of accident damage, clear separation of regulatory and safety bureaus with a new and independent administrating agency, community participation and agreement regarding the safety system and levels, which is the major concern of 80% Korean. To tackle threats of nuclear disaster in neighboring nations like China, a new position entitled ‘Ambassador for nuclear safety diplomacy’ is highly necessary. The nuclear safety of Korea should no longer be the monopoly of those nuclear engineers and limited technocrats criticized as a ‘nuclear mafia’."
730,Alcohol Consumption and Mortality in the Korean Multi-center Cancer Cohort Study,En-Joo Jung,2012,대한예방의학회,"Objectives: To examine the association between alcohol consumption habit, types of beverages, alcohol consumption quantity, and overall and cancer-specific mortality among Korean adults.
Methods: The alcohol consumption information of a total of 16 320 participants who were 20 years or older from the Korean Multicenter Cancer Cohort were analyzed to examine the association between alcohol consumption habit and mortality (median follow-up of 9.3 years). The Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of alcohol consumption to mortality adjusting for age, sex, geographic areas, education, smoking status, and body mass index.
Results: Alcohol drinkers showed an increased risk for total mortality compared with never drinkers (HR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38 to 2.14 for past drinkers; HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.39 for current drinkers), while past drinkers only were associated with higher risk for cancer deaths (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.53). The quantity of alcohol consumed per week showed a J-shaped association with risk of mortality. Relative to light drinkers (0.01 to 90 g/wk), never drinkers and heavy drinkers ( >504 g/wk) had an increased risk for all-cause and cancer deaths: (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.45) and (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.83) for all-cause mortality; and (HR,1.55; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.11) and (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.39 to 3.09) for all cancer mortality, respectively. Heavy drinkers (>504 g/wk) showed an elevated risk for death from stomach and liver cancers.
Conclusions: The present study supports the existence of a J-shaped association between alcohol consumption quantity and the risk of all-cause and cancer deaths. Heavy drinkers had an increased risk of death from cancer overall and liver and stomach cancer."
731,The efficacy of the time-scheduled decremental continuous infusion of fentanyl for postoperative patient-controlled analgesia after total intravenous anesthesia,김종엽 /Kim Jong Yeop,2013,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: Intravenous fentanyl has been used for acute postoperative pain management, but has not always provided reliable adequate analgesia, including patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of time-scheduled decremental infusion of fentanyl for postoperative analgesia.
Methods: Ninety-nine patients, aged 20-65 years, undergoing laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomy using total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) were randomly assigned into one of the three groups. Their background infusions of fentanyl diluent (2 ml/hr of diluent was equivalent with 0.5 μg/kg/hr of fentanyl) with PCA were maintained at the fixed-rate of 2 ml/hr until the postoperative 24 hr (FX2-2-2), or at the decremental rates of 6.0, 4.0, 2.0 ml/hr (D6-4-2) and 8.0, 4.0, 2.0 ml/hr (D8-4-2). The visual analogue score (VAS), incidence of inadequate analgesia, frequency of PCA intervention, and side effects were evaluated.
Results: VAS was significantly higher in FX2-2-2 than in D6-4-2 and D8-4-2 until postoperative 3 hr (P < 0.05). After postoperative 4 hr, VAS was significantly higher in FX2-2-2 than D8-4-2 (P < 0.05). The incidence of inadequate analgesia of FX2-2-2 was significantly greater than D6-4-2 (P = 0.038) and D8-4-2 (P < 0.001) until postoperative 1 hr. None of the patients had ventilatory depression, and postoperative nausea and vomiting were not significant among the groups.
Conclusions: The time-scheduled decremental background infusion regimens of fentanyl, based on the pharmacokinetic model, could provide more effective postoperative pain management after TIVA, and the side effects and the risk for morbidity were not different from the fixed-rate infusion regimen."

A retrospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV infection among HIV-infected women in Korea. HPV DNA genotype and cervical cytology were examined in 60 HIV-positive women and 1,938 HIV-negative women. HPV genotypes were analyzed by using a HPV DNA chip. HIV-infected women had higher prevalence of high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection (30% vs 4.9%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 6.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.63-13.34, P<0.001) and abnormal cervical cytology (18.3% vs 1.8%, AOR, 10.94; 95% CI, 5.18-23.1, P<0.001) compared with controls. The most common hr-HPV genotype detected in HIV-infected women was HPV 16 (10%), followed by 18 (6.7%) and 52 (5%). Prevalence of quadrivalent vaccine-preventable types (HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18) was 21.7% and 2.3% in HIV-positive women and HIV-negative women, respectively. Age was a significant risk factor for hr-HPV infection in HIV-infected women (P=0.039). The presence of hr-HPV was significantly associated with abnormal cervical cytology (P<0.001). These findings suggest that HPV testing for cervical cancer screening in HIV-infected women would be necessary, particularly among young age group."

734,The Significance of Gastric Juice Analysis for a Positive Challenge by a Standard Oral Challenge Test in Typical Cow’s Milk Protein-Induced Enterocolitis,황진복,2008,대한의학회,"This study was performed to investigate the significance of gastric juice analysis (GJA) as a diagnostic criterion of a positive challenge in a standard oral cow’s milk challenge (OCC) to confirm typical cow’s milk protein-induced enterocolitis (CMPIE).
Data from 16 CMPIE patients (aged 14 to 44 days) were analyzed. A standard OCC was openly executed using 0.15 g/kg of protein. Three symptoms (vomiting, lethargy, and bloody or pus-like stool), and four laboratory findings (GJA [3 hr], changes in peripheral blood absolute neutrophil count [ANC] [6 hr], C-reactive protein [6 hr], and stool smear test for occult blood or leukocytes) were observed after OCC.
Before OCC, baseline studies were conducted; a stool smear test, blood sampling, and GJA. Positive OCC results were; vomiting (87.5%) (observed 1-3 hr after OCC), lethargy (62.5%) (1-3 hr), bloody or pus-like stool (43.8%) (6-10 hr), abnormal GJA (93.8%), an ANC rise >3,500 cells/ L (93.8%), and an abnormal stool smear test (75.0%). A single GJA test after a standard OCC is a sensitive diagnostic criterion of a positive challenge, and may provide an early confirmatory diagnosis of CMPIE.
An investigation of positive OCC outcomes helps to find out a diagnostic algorithm of criteria of a positive challenge in CMPIE."
735,The expression of survivin and its related genes in adipocytederived stem cell by demethylation,윤광,2010,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: Survivin is thought to contribute to stem cell maintenance partly by a hypomethylation mechanism.
This study attempted to elucidate the signal transduction pathway of adipocyte-derived stem cells (ASCs) by using a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (ADC), to analyze the survivin, MEK/ERK, c-Myc and p53 gene expression.
Methods: Demethylation in the ASCs was induced by 1 μM ADC treatment. RT-PCR for survivin mRNA was preformed, before and 24, 48 and 72 hours (hr) after ADC treatment. Western blotting analysis was performed for p53, survivin, unphosphorylated and phosphorylated (p)-MEK, and p-ERK. Immunohistochemistry for ERK and survivin was done to evaluate the localization of the proteins.
Results: ADC inhibited the population growth of the ASCs and it increased the number of apoptotic cells 24, 48, and 72 hr after treatment. ADC treatment slightly decreased the expression of survivin mRNA after 48 hr and its level was restored after 72 hr of treatment. Otherwise, the level of survivin protein gradually increased up to 48 hr and it was decreased at 72 hr. The levels of p–MEK and p53 were increased time-dependently. c-Myc and p-ERK were elevated after ADC treatment and their highest levels were seen 48 hr after treatment. The ADC treatment increased the nuclear expression of ERK and survivin in the ASCs.
Conclusions: The overexpression of p-MEK/ERK, p53, and c-Myc increased the survivin protein expression of the demethylated ASCs. These results suggest that demethylation could alter the expression of survivin, and p53, c-Myc and the MAPK (MEK/ERK) pathway might play a role in survivin’s regulation in ASCs."

HR은 실시간 전송이 시간차를 둔 전송에 비하여 초반에 급격한 HR 증가를 일으키는 결과를 나타냈다. 본 연구결과는 뉴스의 실시간성이 수용자의 비자발적이고 즉각적인 반응을 결정짓는 중요 변인이긴 하지만 주관적 뉴스 평가에 유의미한 차이를 만드는 변인은 아니라는 점을 시사한다.This study examined how the perceived liveness of news information alters the viewer's processing of the news. Both psychophysioloical (skin conductance and heart rate) and self-report measures (attention, sense of immediacy, news-value evaluation), were incorporated. A series of two experiments were conducted: The first experiment followed a 2(Liveness:Live, Recorded) x 2(Valence: Positive, Negative) factorial design (N=40).
Liveness resulted in a marginally significant main effect on skin conductance. No meaningful effect of liveness was found in terms of the participants' self-report responses. A follow-up 2(Transmission time:Realtime, Replay) x 2(Valence: Positive, Negative) factorial experiment was implemented (N=60). The significant main effect of liveness on SCL disappeared in the second experiment, but the HR acceleration was significantly more evident in Realtime condition. The same patterns as the first experiment results were found in terms of the self-report measures. The results suggest that liveness of news information is an important factor that alters the viewers' psychophysiological responses but it hardly affects the viewers' subjective evaluation of the news.breaking news, liveness, valence, psychophysiological response, journalism value"

Previously, we have shown that green tea extract (GTE) lowers the intestinal absorption of lipids and lipid-soluble compounds in rats. This study was conducted to investigate a possible role of GTE on the lymphatic absorption of elaidic acid, a major trans fat in the diet. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with lymph duct cannula were infused via an intraduodenal catheter at 3.0 mL/hr for 8 hr with a lipid emulsion containing 180.0 μmol elaidic acid, 400.0 μmol triolein, 20.7 μmol cholesterol, 3.1 μmol α-tocopherol, and 396.0 μmol sodium-taurocholate with or without (control) GTE in a 24 mL PBS buffer (pH, 6.4). Simultaneously, lymph was collected hourly for 8 hr via the lymph duct cannula. There was a significant difference in lymph flow by GTE. Also, the lymphatic absorption of elaidic acid for 8 hr was significantly lower in rats infused with GTE than in those not infused with GTE. Similarly, GTE infusion decreased the lymphatic outputs of cholesterol, oleic acid, and phospholipids, compared with the controls. These findings provide clear evidence that GTE has an inhibitory effect on the intestinal absorption of elaidic acid and other lipids. Our work here provides the foundation for further studies to examine and evaluate dietary strategies to ameliorate dietary trans fats from the diet."

Mod. 9Cr-1Mo steel specimens at austenite temperature were quenched to the molten salt baths at 760oC and 700oC, in which the specimens were kept for 10 min ~ 10 hr with subsequent air-cooling. Impact tests showed that the impact value dropped abruptly when the specimens were kept longer than 30 min at ~760oC reaching to minima in about 1 hr, and then increasing at further retention. The tensile strength of the specimens reached the minimum value without much change afterward, whereas the values of elongation showed the same trend as that of the impact value. The isothermally heat-treated steel at 700oC also showed a minimum impact value in about 1 hr. These results suggest that the isothermal heattreatment at 760 and 700oC for about 1 hr induces temporal embrittlement in Mod. 9Cr-1Mo steel. The microstructural examination of all the specimens with extraction replica of the carbides revealed that the specimens with temporal embrittlement had Cr2C, indicating that the cause of the embrittlement was the precipitation of the Cr2C. In addition, TEM/EDX results showed that the Fe/Cr ratio was 0.033 to 0.055 for Cr2C, whereas it was 0.48 to 0.75 for Cr23C6, making the distinction of the Cr2C and Cr23C6 possible even without direct electron diffraction analyses."

Fire mistaken dispatch occurred yearly average 48,371±5,763 time at 95 % confidence level. This is 1.2 times more than the dispatch for extinguishing the fire. Fire mistaken dispatch has been increased mainly by malfunctioning alarm among other various reasons and the reason of mistaken dispatch is different depending on the population of the region. In big cities, the burning smell accounts for the most of mistaken dispatch but in rural areas, the garbage incineration is the major reason for mistaken dispatch. As a result of calculating the mean time between fire mistaken dispatches (MTBFmd)by region, MTBFmd of Daejeon is 20.61 hr/time and its reliability is 95.26 % at t=1 hr. On the other hand, the MTBFmd of Gyeonggi is 0.58 hr/time and its reliability is 17.91 % at t=1 hr."
741,Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Advanced Gastric Cancer in Elderly and Non-elderly Patients: Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,장성환,2017,대한암학회,"Purpose This study evaluated the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy on elderly patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) using meta-analysis of well-designed randomized controlled clinical studies.
Materials and Methods PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched to retrieve clinical studies evaluating the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in the elderly with AGC. Hazards ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled across studies using a fixed-effects model.
Results Two studies were included in this meta-analysis to estimate HR for the overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) between adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery in elderly and non-elderly patients. HR for OS in the elderly and non-elderly was 0.745 (95% CI, 0.552 to 1.006, p=0.055) and 0.636 (95% CI, 0.522 to 0.776; p < 0.001), respectively, which showed no heterogeneity regarding HR between the two groups (pinteraction=0.389). HR for RFS in the elderly and non-elderly was 0.613 (95% CI, 0.466 to 0.806; p < 0.001) and 0.633 (95% CI, 0.533 to 0.753; p < 0.001), respectively (pinteraction=0.846).
Conclusion Meta-analysis suggests that the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy to the elderly is not big enough to reach statistical significance while the HR for OS is less than 1 (0.745) and no heterogeneity are observed regarding the HR between the elderly and non-elderly patients."
742,반복 입원 천식환자에서 호흡곤란 인지능의 변화,서일국,2011,대한천식알레르기학회,"Background: Anti-asthma treatments correct impaired dyspnea perception.
Objective: To investigate whether dyspnea perception in asthmatics vary whenever they are hospitalized.
Method: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 64 patients (32 men and 32 women) with acute asthma who were hospitalized at least twice and assessed using the Borg scale-based dyspnea perception score while breathing through an inspiratory muscle trainer at each admission.
Poor perceiver was defined as a Borg score of ≤5 at the highest resistive load (HR) and HR-induced ΔBorg score of ≤3.
Result: Between the first and second admissions, the relationship of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (r=0.773, P ＜0.001) and the concordance of severity of asthma attack (κ=0.503, P＜0.001) were significant, but the relationship of HR-induced ΔBorg score and the concordance of poor perceivers were not. During the first admission, as lung function increased gradually, the HR-induced ΔBorg score became higher in poor perceivers (1.83±0.39→3.42±0.57→4.00±0.67, P=0.048).
Conclusion: Although asthmatic patients who suffered from a severe asthma attack tended to have a severe attack again at the following admission, dyspnea perception differs among the admissions. Impaired dyspnea perception during acute asthmatic attack would be correctable with anti-asthma treatments."

However, the procedure causes severe pain due to thoracic expansion. This study was designed to investigate the analgesic effect of small doses of ketamine on an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) using hydromorphone and ketorolac for pain control after Nuss surgery.
Methods: Forty-four patients undergoing elective Nuss surgery were randomly assigned to receive hydromorphone 3μg/kg/hr, ketorolac 0.05 mg/kg/hr and ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg/day (Group HO, n = 22) or hydromorphone 3 μg/kg/hr, ketorolac 0.05 mg/kg/hr, ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg/day and ketamine 0.15 mg/kg/hr (Group HK, n = 22) via an IVPCA pump after surgery. A blind observer evaluated each patient using the Modified Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) for the assessment of pain control. The total administered PCA volume, side effects and parents satisfaction with pain control were assessed at postoperative 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours.
Results: There were no significant differences in Modified CHEOPS between the groups during postoperative 48hours. The total PCA volume in group HK was significantly lower than that in group HO (P < 0.05). The side effects in both groups did not significantly differ except for pruritus. The levels of satisfaction from the parents were not significantly different between the groups.
Conclusions: A small dose of ketamine on IV-PCA reduced the total administered dose of IV-PCA with hydromorphone and ketorolac and reduced the incidence of pruritus after the Nuss procedure in pediatric patients.Background: Nuss surgery is preferred in pectus excavatum repair because this procedure produces excellent cosmetic results and prevents postoperative distressed pulmonary function.

Methods: A total of 101 patients (April 2007 to August2010) underwent RFA for residual or recurrent HCC afterTACE. We analyzed their long-term outcomes and predictivefactors.
Results: The overall survival rates after RFA were93.1%, 65.4%, and 61.0% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Predictive factors for favorable overall survival were Child-Pugh class A (hazard ratio [HR], 3.45; p=0.001), serumα-fetoprotein (AFP) level <20 ng/mL (HR, 2.90; p=0.02), andrecurrent tumors after the last TACE (HR, 3.14; p=0.007). The cumulative recurrence-free survival rate after RFA at 6months was 50.1%. Predictive factors for early recurrence(within 6 months) were serum AFP level ≥20 ng/mL (HR, 3.02;p<0.001), tumor size ≥30 mm at RFA (HR, 2.90; p=0.005),and nonresponse to the last TACE (HR, 2.13; p=0.013).
Conclusions:Patients with recurrent or residual HCC who undergoprior TACE show a favorable overall survival, althoughtheir tumors seem to recur early and frequently. While goodliver function, a low serum AFP level, and recurrent tumorswere independent predictive factors for a favorable overallsurvival, poor response to TACE, a high serum AFP level, andlarge tumors are associated with early recurrence."

748,Difference of the hemodynamic changes induced by tracheal intubation using remifentanil between smokers and nonsmokers,성상훈,2010,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: It was well-known that smoking affects the cardiovascular system, and remifentanil can suppress the sympathetic stimulations induced by tracheal intubation. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there was any difference in the hemodynamic changes induced by tracheal intubation with using remifentanil between smokers and nonsmokers.
Methods: Eighty patients were enrolled: male smokers (MS), male nonsmokers (MN), female smokers (FS) and female nonsmokers (FN). Anesthesia was induced with diluted remifentanil (20 μg/ml) at a rate of 10 μg/kg/hr using an infusion pump, and 2 min later, midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and propofol 0.8 mg/kg were injected for achieving unconsciousness. Rocuronium 1 mg/kg was used for muscle relaxation, and tracheal intubation was performed 2 min after rocuronium injection. After tracheal intubation, the remifentanil was decreased to 2 μg/kg/hr. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were checked before induction, on unconsciousness, just before intubation, just after intubation and 1, 2 and 3 minutes after intubation, and these values were compared between the groups.
Results: In men, the MAP and HR just after intubation and at 1, 2 and 3 minutes after intubation in Group MS were significantly higher than those of Group MN (P < 0.05). For the women, the HR in both groups (the FS and FN groups) were increased just after intubation and 1, 2 and 3 minutes after intubation compared with that at the baseline, respectively, but there was no difference between the two groups.
Conclusions: There was a difference of the hemodynamic changes induced by tracheal intubation with using remifentanil between the male smokers and nonsmokers, but not in women."

R3 in which the functions of the reactors were exchanged, employing 1.2 and 1.3 hours HRT for anoxic and anaerobic functions, respectively resulting to good nitrogen removal efficiency and Specific Nitrification Ratio (SNR) of 2.46 mgNH4 +-N/gVSS·hr. The sequencing batch reactor operation in R1 resulted to lowest nitrogen removal efficiency and SNR of 1.64 mgNH4 +-N/gVSS·hr. In terms of Specific Denitrification Ratio (SDNR), 2.03 mgNO3 −-N/gVSS·hr was produced by R3 while 1.41 mgNO3 −-N /gVSS·hr was produced by R1. Considering the nitrogen removal efficiency, the operating condi- tions of R3 appeared to be more favorable. R6 performed with continuous influent injection for the anoxic and anaerobic reactors done at the same time with a flow ratio of 2 : 8 resulted to nitrogen and phosphorus effluent concentration of 13.7 mg/L and 1.19 mg/L, respectively. R6 attained the highest removal efficiency considering both nitrogen and phosphorus among all the experiments performed. In terms of the most economical operating conditions, internal recycle rate of 2Q and 5% media packing ratio should be considered.Advanced wastewater treatment, Hybrid process, A2/O, SBR, Media"

We performed this study to describe the HRA algorithm and evaluate the accuracy of an HRA program for 10-yr mortality prediction in Korean men. We used data derived from periodic health examinations of 116,927 male public officials and school personnel aged 20 or older. Risk age and the difference between risk age and calendar age were calculated. We obtained the hazard ratio (HR) of 10-yr mortality according to the calculated age difference. Of the 116,927 subjects, 1,900(1.6%) died during the 10 yr after the 1992 medical examinations. The HR of 10-yr mortality increased significantly with age difference. Compared with the HR in the reference group (age difference below 2 yr), the HR in the group with a 2- to 6-yr age difference was 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05 to 1.38) and HR in the group with more than 7-yr age difference was 1.35 (95% CI: 1.14 to 1.75). Risk age is a relatively good predictor of 10-yr mortality in Korean men and may be useful in identifying high-risk middle-aged men for health interventions."
754,Comparative Evaluation of Three Chromogenic Media Combined with Broth Enrichment and the Real-Time PCR-Based Xpert MRSA Assay for Screening of Methicillin- Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Nasal Swabs,이승옥 /LEE SEUNG OK,2013,대한진단검사의학회,"Background: We evaluated the performance of three chromogenic media (Brilliance agar I [Oxoid, UK], Brilliance agar II [Oxoid], and ChromID MRSA [Biomérieux, France]) combined with broth enrichment and the Xpert MRSA assay for screening of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
Methods: We obtained 401 pairs of duplicate nasal swabs from 321 patients. One swab was suspended overnight in tryptic soy broth; 50-μL aliquots of suspension were inoculated on the three chromogenic media. Brilliance agar I and II were examined after 24 hr, and ChromID MRSA, after 24 and 48 hr. The paired swab was processed directly using realtime PCR-based Xpert MRSA assay.
Results: True positives, designated as MRSA growth in any of the culture media, were detected with the prevalence of 17% in our institution. We report the sensitivity, specificity,positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MRSA growth as follows: 92.3%,94.0%, 75.9%, and 98.4% in Brilliance agar I (24 hr); 92.7%, 97.9%, 90.0%, and 98.5% in Brilliance agar II (24 hr); 95.6%, 95.8%, 82.3%, and 99.1% in ChromID MRSA (24 hr);100%, 92.5%, 73.1%, and 100% in ChromID MRSA (48 hr); 92.6%, 96.7%, 85.1%, and 98.5% in Xpert MRSA assay. The agreement between the enriched culture and Xpert MRSA assay was 96.0%.
Conclusions: Three chromogenic culture media combined with enrichment and Xpert MRSA assay demonstrated similar capabilities in MRSA detection. The Xpert MRSA assay yielded results comparable to those of culture methods, saving 48-72 hr, thus facilitating earlier detection of MRSA in healthcare settings."
755,Gene expression variability between randomly and targeted transgene integration events in tobacco suspension cell lines,Janina Kirchhoff,2020,한국식물생명공학회,"Genome editing tools such as zinc-finger nucleases provide novel strategies for genetic manipulation in plants. Unlike agrobacterium- mediated or direct gene transfer, which introduce genes randomly into the genome and thereby potentially resulting in high variation of gene expression, the targeted gene addition provides predictable integration of DNA sequences into a specified location of the plant genome. We investigated whether various independent cell lines that all contain a transgene placed in the same genomic locus by zinc-finger nuclease-mediated homologous recombination (HR) would yield a more reproducible and homogeneous level of expression compared to integration events generated via agrobacterium-mediated transformation at random sites. The variance of gene expression of targeted HR events and random integration events was analyzed in Nicotiana tabacum L cv. Bright Yellow 2 (BY-2) suspension cells by measuring protein amount produced from the transgene by flow cytometry, thus providing the first report on positional effects of marker gene expression in a quickly proliferating plant suspension cell line. Marker protein levels of targeted HR and single-copy random events covered a similar range; however, the uniformity of protein expression in a given cell line was significantly higher in targeted events than in lines with randomly inserted transgene; the same is true for the overall viability of protoplasts from HR lines. In conclusion, using targeted insertion into a qualified locus of a well-characterized line leads to more reliable results than random insertion into the genome."

This prospective observational study was conducted between August and December 2011 in medical ICUs at Samsung Medical Center. AFXa levels between 0.1 and 0.3 U/mL were considered to be effective for antithrombotic activity. Fifty-five patients were included. The median aFXa levels were 0.22 (IQR 0.17-0.26) at 4 hr, 0.06 (IQR 0.02-0.1) at 12 hr, and 0 U/mL (IQR 0-0.03) at 24 hr. The numbers of patients showing effective antithrombotic aFXa levels were 48 (87.3%), 18 (32.7%),and 0 (0%) at 4, 12 and 24 hr, respectively. At 12 hr, higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores and hyperbilirubinemia were significantly associated with low aFXa levels (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36-0.93; P = 0.02 and 0.06; 0.003-0.87; 0.04,respectively). Once daily dose of 40 mg of enoxaparin is inadequate for maintaining effective antithrombotic aFXa levels, and the inadequacy is more salient for patients with high SOFA scores and hyperbilirubinemia."

This was done by observing their conditioning and measuring their blood constituents before and after a multi-staged intermittent training program, over 2 weeks. Three national handicapped cyclists were placed in a multi-leveled hypobaric-hypoxic (flat–4000 meter (m) high elevation) environment with consistent temperature and humidity (23 ± 2℃, 50 ± 5%) for 2 weeks. After the training, the blood constituents and average heart rate (HR) were measured and the following results were obtained.
In all three athletes, there were no unique changes in red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, while there was a rise in the reticulocyte count. Observations of the difference in average HR during exercise at varying altitudes showed that athlete A had an average increase in the HR for the first 5 days at 2000 m. For athlete B, the comparison of the first and last training sessions at an altitude of 2000 m showed an HR increase of approximately 17%. For athlete C, there was a steady increase in the HR until day 7 of the training. As such, hypobarichypoxic training suggested that improvement of aerobic exercise performance in these athletes and it is recommended that there be a development for future training programs at high altitude, geared towards handicapped athletes of various disciplines."

Methods: Sixty children aged 6 months to 12 years undergoing CP surgery under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to the control (C) or dexmedetomidine (D) groups. Group C received benzodiazepine (0.05 mg/kg midazolam followed by infusion of normal saline) fentanyl isoflurane anesthesia, and Group D received dexmedetomidine (loading 1 μg/kg followed by infusion of 0.5 μg/kg/h) fentanyl isoflurane anesthesia. Heart rate (HR), mean blood pressure (MBP), intraoperative fentanyl and isoflurane requirements, recovery scores, emergence agitation, pain scores, time and requirement of rescue analgesic, and surgeon satisfaction were noted.
Results: Intraoperative HR and MBP in Group D were significantly lower than the corresponding values in Group C (P < 0.001). HR decreased up to 16% in Group D. By contrast, HR increased up to 20% in Group C. Group D had comparable MBP to its baseline, whereas Group C had higher MBP until extubation (P = 0.015). Two children in Group D developed bradycardia and hypotension, which was successfully treated. The fentanyl and isoflurane requirements decreased by 43% and 30%, respectively, in Group D patients compared to those in Group C (P < 0.001). Group D had lower pain scores and less emergence agitation (P < 0.001). Time until requirement of first rescue analgesic was longer in Group D than that in Group C (P < 0.001). Surgeon satisfaction was higher in Group D than that in Group C.
Conclusions: Intravenous dexmedetomidine during CP surgery attenuated hemodynamic responses with excellent surgeon satisfaction. Close monitoring of hemodynamics is recommended."

CPAP을 사용한 후수면다원검사와 이전의 수면다원검사를 비교한 결과 무호흡- 저호흡 지수(42.5/hr→82.8/hr)와 각성 지수(21.7/hr→ 40.8/hr)는 악화되었다. 이에 이차 치료로 ASV를 사용하여 적정압력검사를 시행하였다. 이전의 수면다원검사와 비교한 결과무호흡-저호흡 지수(42.5/hr→8.6/hr)가 상당히 호전되었다. 이러한 결과로 ASV는 중추성 수면 무호흡과 호흡부전에 대한좋은 치료방법이 될 수 있다.Central sleep apnea (CSA) is characterized by respiratory failure of at least 10 seconds without any effort of the chest and abdomen in the absence of upper airway resistance during sleep. In this case, the patient experiences respiratory failure that does not meet the CSA diagnostic criteria and CSA symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-weighted imaging (MRI DWI) scans revealed a lateral medullary infarction. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was applied as a primary treatment for CSA and respiratory failure. During the titration of CPAP, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and arousal index (AI) were worse than the results before its use (AHI: 42.5/hr→82.8/hr, AI: 21.7/hr→40.8h). As a result, adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) was chosen as the secondary treatment. Compared to the night-polysomnography results before the ASV treatment, the AHI improved (42.5/hr→8.6/hr). Therefore, ASV is a potential treatment for CSA and respiratory failure in these patients."

The current study was aimed to identify correlations between resting cardiac autonomic regulation and graded exercise test-derived CR.
METHODS:We recruited apparently healthy men college students aged between 20 and 29 years (n=46). They were assigned to Lowand High groups which have been determined for medians involved in resting heart rate (HR) or HRV indices such as rMSSD, HF, and LF/HF ratio, respectively. CR and post-exercise heart rate recovery (HRR) were calculated from HR fluctuations during and after symptom-limited graded exercise test using the Bruce protocol.
RESULTS: In HRR, there were no significant differences between all Low and High groups separated by resting levels of HR or HRV indices. However, all Low groups assigned according to resting cardiac vagal-related HRV indices such as rMSSD and HF showed significantly lower CR levels than those of High groups, respectively. Moreover, CRs derived from stage 1-3 of Bruce protocol were positively correlated resting rMSSD and HF levels, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS:The findings of the current study suggest that resting levels of cardiac vagal-related HRV indices may have an impact on CR derived from a graded exercise test, as well as there is a significant association between resting cardiac vagal activity and HR response during incremental exercise.Cardiac autonomic regulation, Cardiac vagal activity, Chronotropic responses, Graded exercise test"

Methods: Considering the mechanism of urea breath test, we determined the excretion of urea in expired air after its oral administration in rats and beagle dogs at the dose of 2 mg/kg (including 50 mCi/mmol 14C-urea 50 μCi/kg for rats and 13.5 μCi/kg for dogs). Results: Urea was rapidly disappeared from the blood circulation by 1 hr after its i.v. bolus injection, followed by a slow disappearance by 24 hr. The half-lives at the distributive phase (t1/2α) and post-distributive phase (t1/2β) were 2 min and 6 hr, respectively. The bioavailability of urea was 64.3% after its oral administration. The values of the volume of distribution (Vdss) and the total body clearance (CLt) after the oral administration were compatible with those after i.v. administration. The recovery of urea in the bile was about 0.1% of the dose by 24 hr after its oral administration. Urea was extensively eliminated in the urine by 48hr. The recovery ratios of urea in the urine and expired air were about 86.8% and 2.99% of the dose by 48 hr, respectively.
Moreover, urea was mostly distributed from the blood circulation to the kidney, followed by being eliminated in the urine without metabolism. The concentration of urea in the kidney was 4.0 times higher than that of plasma at 40min after its oral administration.

The subjects are consisted of 250 male aging from 18 to 34 and we separated them into two groups randomly; 179 for a sample, 71 for a cross-validation group. They went through maximal exercise testing with Bruce protocol, and we measured the metabolic responses in the end of the first(3 minute) and second stage(6 minute). To predict O2max, we applied multiple regression analysis to the sample with stepwise method. Model 1’s variables are weight, 6 minute HR and 6 minute O2(R=0.64, SEE=4.74, CV=11.7%, p<.01), and the equation is VO2max(ml/kg/min)= 72.256-0.340(Weight)-0.220(6minHR)+0.013(6minVO2). Model 2’s variables are weight, 6 minute HR, 6 minute O2, and 6 minute CO2(R=0.67, SEE=4.59, CV=11.3%, p<.01), and the equation is VO2max(ml/kg/min)= 68.699-0.277(Weight) -0.206(6minHR)+0.020(6minVO2)-0.009(6minVCO2). And the result did not show multicolinearity for both models. Model 2 demonstrated more correlation compared to Model 1. However, when we conducted cross-validation of those models with 71 men, measured VO2max and estimated VO2 Max had statistical significance with correlation (R=0.53, 0.56, P<.01). Although both models are functional with validity considering their simplicity and utility, Model 2 has more accuracy."
765,Afatinib Reduces STAT6 Signaling of Host ARPE-19 Cells Infected with Toxoplasma gondii,Zhaoshou Yang,2016,대한기생충학ㆍ열대의학회,"Specific gene expressions of host cells by spontaneous STAT6 phosphorylation are major strategy for the survival of intracellular Toxoplasma gondii against parasiticidal events through STAT1 phosphorylation by infection provoked IFN-γ. We determined the effects of small molecules of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on the growth of T. gondii and on the relationship with STAT1 and STAT6 phosphorylation in ARPE-19 cells. We counted the number of T. gondii RH tachyzoites per parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) after treatment with TKIs at 12-hr intervals for 72 hr. The change of STAT6 phosphorylation was assessed via western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Among the tested TKIs, Afatinib (pan ErbB/EGFR inhibitor, 5 µM) inhibited 98.0% of the growth of T. gondii, which was comparable to pyrimethamine (5 µM) at 96.9% and followed by Erlotinib (ErbB1/EGFR inhibitor, 20 µM) at 33.8% and Sunitinib (PDGFR or c-Kit inhibitor, 10 µM) at 21.3%. In the early stage of the infection (2, 4, and 8 hr after T. gondii challenge), Afatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT6 in western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Both JAK1 and JAK3, the upper hierarchical kinases of cytokine signaling, were strongly phosphorylated at 2 hr and then disappeared entirely after 4 hr. Some TKIs, especially the EGFR inhibitors, might play an important role in the inhibition of intracellular replication of T. gondii through the inhibition of the direct phosphorylation of STAT6 by T. gondii."

Methods: Sixty women who received a cesarean section were randomly divided into 3 groups. Each group received butorphanol 3 mg (Group 1), 5 mg (Group 2) or 7 mg (Group 3) with ketorolac 150 mg. Butorphanol and ketorolac were administerd by a two day infusor at the rate of 2 ml/hr. Assessments for pain with NRS, and side effects were evaluated in the recovery room, at 3 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr and 48 hr after the operation. A patient satisfaction score was evaluated at 24 hr and 48 hr after the operation.
Results: Pain score at 3 hr after the operation was significantly lower ine Group 2 than Group 1 (P ＜ 0.05), at 6 hr and 12 hr after the operation was significantly lower in Group 2 and Group 3 than Group 1 (P ＜ 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between Group 2 and Group 3. Patient satisfaction score at 24 hr and 48 hr after the operation did not show any significant difference among the three groups. One patient in Group 2 revealed sedation over 3 on a 4-point scale at 3 hr after the operation, but there was no significant difference among the three groups.
Conclusions: The above results suggested that both butorphanol 5 mg and 7 mg with ketorolac 150 mg via IVPCA were an effective dosage for postoperative pain control during two days after a cesarean section without any significant side effects."

768,개질된 Nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron을 이용한 질산성질소 처리,김홍석 /Hong-Seok Kim,2009,대한상하수도학회,"A Nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron(NZVI) was modified to build a reactor system to treat nitrate. Shell layer of the NZVI was modified by slow exposure of the iron surface to air flow, which produced NZVI particles that are resistant to aerial oxidation. A XANES (X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure) analysis revealed that the shell consists of magnetite (Fe3O4) dominantly. The shell-modified NZVI(0.5 g NZVI/ 120 mL) was able to degrade more than 95% of 30 mg/L of nitrate within 30 hr-1 (pseudo first-order rate constant(kSA) normalzed to NZVI surface area (17.96 m2/g) : 0.0050 L·m-2·hr-1). Ammonia occupied about 90% of degradation products of nitrate. Nitrate degradation efficiencies increased with the increase of NZVI dose generally. Initial pH values of the reactor systems at 4, 7, and 10 did not affect nitrate removal rate and final pH values of all experiments were near 12. Nitrate removal experiments by using the shell-modified NZVI immobilized on a cellulose acetate(CA) membrane were also conducted. The nitrate removal efficiency of the CA membrane supported NZVI (kSA= 0.0036 L·m-2·hr-1) was less than that of the NZVI slurries(kSA= 0.0050 L·m-2·hr-1), which is probably due to less surface area available for reduction and to kinetic retardation by nitrate transport through the CA membrane. The detachment of the NZVI from the CA membrane was minimal and impregnation of up to 1g of NZVI onto 1g of the CA membrane was found feasible.Nanoscal Zero-Valent Iron, Oxidation-resistant Shell, Cellulose Acetate Membrane, Nitrate, Immobilization"
769,Beneficial Effects of Adding Ketamine to Intravenous Patient-Controlled Analgesia with Fentanyl after the Nuss Procedure in Pediatric Patients,차문호,2012,연세대학교의과대학,"Purpose: The aim of this prospective, double-blind, randomized study was to investigate the analgesic effects of low-dose ketamine on intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) with fentanyl for pain control in pediatric patients following the Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum. Materials and Methods: Sixty pediatric patients undergoing the Nuss procedure were randomly assigned to receive fentanyl (Group F, n=30) or fentanyl plus ketamine (Group FK, n=30). Ten minutes before the end of surgery, following the loading dose of each solution, 0.5 μg/kg/hr of fentanyl or 0.5 μg/kg/hr of fentanyl plus 0.15 mg/kg/hr of ketamine was infused via an IV-PCA pump (basal rate, 1 mL/hr; bolus, 0.5 mL; lock out interval,30 min). Fentanyl consumption, pain score, ketorolac use, nausea/vomiting, ondansetron use, pruritus, respiratory depression, hallucination, dreaming, and parent satisfaction with pain control were measured throughout the 48 hours following surgery. Results: The pain scores, ketorolac use, and fentanyl consumption of Group FK were significantly lower than in Group F (p<0.05). The incidence of nausea/vomiting and ondansetron use in Group FK was significantly lower than in Group F (p<0.05). There were no reports of respiratory depression, hallucination or dreaming. Parent satisfaction with pain control was similar between the two groups. Conclusion: We concluded that low-dose ketamine added to IV-PCA with fentanyl after the Nuss procedure in pediatric patients can reduce pain scores, consumption of fentanyl, and incidence of nausea/vomiting without increasing side effects."
770,Melatonin does not attenuate dynamic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular reflex responses to acute hypotension in healthy men,방지윤,2012,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: Melatonin has been shown to attenuate the reflex sympathetic increases that arise in response to orthostatic challenges. We tested the hypothesis that the attenuated sympathetic increase induced by melatonin premedication may weaken the arterial blood pressure (ABP) preserving the capability during acute hypotension, thereby altering dynamic cerebral autoregulation and causing a further decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF).
Methods: Acute hypotension was induced in 12 healthy subjects by releasing bilateral thigh cuffs before and after an oral dose of melatonin (0.2 mg/kg). Heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (ABP), Modelflow estimate of cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance (TPR) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by transcranial Doppler were measured.
Results: Steady state HR, the mean arterial pressure and CBFV were not altered 60 minutes after melatonin ingestion. Reduced systolic arterial pressure (ΔSAP), changes in HR (ΔHR), CO (ΔCO), and TPR (ΔTPR), ΔHR/ΔSAP and percentage restoration of SAP were not affected after a temporal decrease in ABP induced by thigh cuff release. In the cerebral circulation, melatonin did not affect changes in CBFV, cerebrovascular resistance index, the rate of regulation and percentage restoration of CBFV following a sudden decrease in ABP.
Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, melatonin did not affect the rapid vasodilatory and recovery responses of cardiovascular and dynamic cerebral autoregulation. These results suggest that melatonin premedication may not impair ABP and CBF preserving capability induced by sudden postural changes or hemorrhage."

Heysell,2015,대한결핵및호흡기학회,"Background: Reports of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for second-line medications to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remain limited.
Methods: A retrospective cohort from the Virginia state tuberculosis (TB) registry, 2009–2014, was analyzed for TDM usage in MDR-TB. Drug concentrations, measured at time of estimated peak (Cmax), were compared to expected ranges.
Results: Of 10 patients with MDR-TB, 8 (80%) had TDM for at least one drug (maximum 6 drugs). Second-line drugs tested were cycloserine in seven patients (mean C2hr, 16.6±10.2 μg/mL; 4 [57%] below expected range); moxifloxacin in five (mean C2hr, 3.2±1.5 μg/mL; 1 [20%] below); capreomycin in five (mean C2hr, 21.5±14.0 μg/mL; 3 [60%] below); para-aminosalicylic acid in five (mean C6hr, 65.0±29.1 μg/mL; all within or above); linezolid in three (mean C2hr, 11.4±4.1 μg/mL, 1 [33%] below); amikacin in two (mean C2hr, 35.3±3.7 μg/mL; 1 [50%] below); ethionamide in one (C2hr, 1.49 μg/mL, within expected). Two patients died: a 38-year-old woman with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome and TB meningitis without TDM, and a 76-year-old man with fluoroquinolone-resistant (pre-extensively drug-resistant) pulmonary TB and low linezolid and capreomycin concentrations.
Conclusion: Individual pharmacokinetic variability was common. A more standardized approach to TDM for MDR-TB may limit over-testing and maximize therapeutic gain."

Chitin was extracted from ground crab shell by demineralization in 1.0 N HCl solution at 25℃ with or without ultrasonication and deproteinization in 1.0 NaOH solution at 100℃ without ultrasonication and at 70℃ with ultrasonication. Microwave treatment was also used for deproteinization with 5 min heating and 5 min standing without microwave. The changes in color difference, the contents of ash, calcium and nitrogen were measured during demineralization and deproteinization. Ultrasonication of 4 hr in 1.0 N HCl solution for removal of calcium and 1.5 hr of microwave heating in 1.0 N NaOH for deproteinization corresponded to 6 hr in 0.1 N HCl and 2 hr in 1.0 N NaOH of heating at 100℃ without those treatments, respectively. The data obtained showed that these treatments were effective reduction of chitin extraction time by 25～33% for chitin preparation. The chitin obtained from these ultrasonication and microwave treatments resulted 0.55% of ash, 0.25% of calcium, 2.47% of nitrogen and 20.64% of yield ratio. Those treatments selected were also reduced the darkness development time of the chitin solution during demineralization and deproteinization."

It is in need to arrange new criteria for heavy rain considering concept of rainfall intensity and rainfall damage to reflect the changed characteristics of rainfall according to the climate change. Rainfall values of inducing the most frequent rainfall damage are at 30mm/1 hr, 60mm/3 hr,70mm/6 hr, and 110 mm/12 hr, respectively. The cumulative probability of damage occurrences of one in two due to heavy rain shows up at 20 mm/1 hr, 50mm/3 hr, 80 mm/6 hr, and 110 mm/12 hr,respectively. When the relationship between threshold values of heavy rain warning and the possibility of rainfall damage is investigated, rainfall values for high connectivity between heavy rain warning criteria and the possibility of rainfall damage appear at 30 mm/1 hr, 50 mm/3 hr,80 mm/6 hr, and 100 m/12 hr, respectively. It is proper to adopt the daily maximum precipitation intensity of 6 and 12 hours, because 6 hours rainfall might be include the concept of rainfall intensity for very-short-term and short-term unexpectedly happened rainfall and 12 hours rainfall could maintain the connectivity of the previous heavy rain warning system and represent longterm continuously happened rainfall. The optimum combinations of criteria for heavy rain warning of 6 and 12 hours are 80 mm/6 hr or 100~110 mm/12 hr, and 70 mm/6 hr or 100~110 mm/12 hr."
776,"Impaired fasting glucose, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and risk for colorectal cancer in Koreans",정금지 /Jung Keum Ji,2016,한국역학회,"OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies have demonstrated that fasting serum glucose (FSG) levels and certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are related to an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, their combined effects are still unclear.
METHODS: Of a total of 144,527 men and women free of cancer at baseline, 317 developed CRC during 5.3 years of follow-up. A case-cohort study (n=1,691) was used, consisting of participants with a DNA sample available. Three well-known SNPs (rs3802842, rs6983267, rs10795668) were genotyped. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of CRC, colon and rectal cancer were calculated, with the Cox proportional hazard models.
RESULTS: The crude incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were 41.1 overall, 48.4 for men, and 29.3 for women. Among participants with dysglycemia, SNPs rs3802842 and rs6983267 were both associated with an increased risk of CRC (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.5 and HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.1, respectively) and rectal cancer (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.8 to 6.6 and HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.6 to 7.1, respectively). The interaction effect of dysglycemia and SNPs was positive, that is, resulted in an elevated risk of CRC, but was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that both high FSG and certain SNPs are major risk factors for CRC and rectal cancer but that they did not interact synergistically. The difference in effect size of the SNPs according to CRC subtype (i.e., colon or rectal cancer) and presence of dysglycemia merits further research."

Materials and Methods: Forty rats were subjected to oral ingestion by gavage of distilled water (DW) or ascorbic acid (AA) 90 min before the bleaching therapy. For the bleaching treatment, the agent was applied twice for 5 min each to buccal surfaces of the first right mandibular molars. Then, the animals were sacrificed at 6 hr, 24 hr, 3 day, or 7 day post-bleaching, and the teeth were processed for microscopic evaluation of the pulp tissue. Results: At 6 hr, the pulp tissue showed moderate inflammatory reactions in all teeth of both groups. In the DW and AA groups, 100% and 80% of teeth exhibited pulp tissue with significant necrosis and intense tissue disorganization, respectively. At 24 hr, the AA-treated group demonstrated a greater regenerative capability than the DW group, with less intense inflammatory reaction and new odontoblast layer formation in 60% of the teeth. For up to the 7 day period, the areas of pulpal necrosis were replaced by viable connective tissue, and the dentin was underlined by differentiated odontoblast-like cells in most teeth of both groups. Conclusions: A slight reduction in initial pulpal damage during post-bleaching was promoted by AA therapy. However, the pulp tissue of AA-treated animals featured faster regenerative potential over time."
778,Ambulatory heart rate of professional taxi drivers while driving without their typical psychosocial work stressors: a pilot study,최봉규 /BongKyoo Choi,2016,대한직업환경의학회,"Background: Few studies have examined ambulatory cardiovascular physiological parameters of taxi drivers while driving in relation to their occupational hazards. This study aims to investigate and quantify the impact of worksite physical hazards as a whole on ambulatory heart rate of professional taxi drivers while driving without their typical worksite psychosocial stressors.
Methods: Ambulatory heart rate (HRdriving) of 13 non-smoking male taxi drivers (24 to 67 years old) while driving was continuously assessed on their 6-hour experimental on-road driving in Los Angeles. Percent maximum HR range (PMHRdriving) of the drivers while driving was estimated based on the individual HRdriving values and US adult population resting HR (HRrest) reference data. For analyses, the HRdriving and PMHRdriving data were split and averaged into 5-min segments. Five physical hazards inside taxi cabs were also monitored while driving. Work stress and work hours on typical work days were self-reported.
Results: The means of the ambulatory 5-min HRdriving and PMHRdriving values of the 13 drivers were 80.5 bpm (11.
2 bpm higher than their mean HRrest) and 10.7 % (range, 5.7 to 19.9 %), respectively. The means were lower than the upper limits of ambulatory HR and PMHR for a sustainable 8-hour work (35 bpm above HRrest and 30 % PMHR), although 15–27 % of the 5-min HRdriving and PMHRdriving values of one driver were higher than the limits. The levels of the five physical hazards among the drivers were modest: temperature (26.4 ± 3.0 °C), relative humidity (40.7 ± 10.

All the Pacific oysters were kept under fasting conditions for 3 days to prevent the influence of food and excretions before the onset of the experiments. SVMs did not detect at 5℃. However, SVMs increased with an increase in temperature (at 10℃: 6.31±2.18times/hr and at 20℃: 22.0±10.0times/hr). At 30℃, SVMs were divided into two groups: those with no SVMs as at 5℃ and those with SVMs similar to conditions at 20℃ (23.9±9.35times/hr). This indicates oyster shells maintain a closed condition due to a decrease in metabolism at 30℃, although some Pacific oysters had active SVMs due to an increase in metabolism. If a BMS using the SVM status of Pacific oysters was installed to monitor abnormal high water around oyster farms, early warning levels and serious alerts might be made available more rapidly for SVMs of more than ca. 30 times/hr and closing conditions in a matter of hours, respectively. Therefore, a BMS using the SVMs of Pacific oysters might be an effective early warning system for abnormal high water temperatures.Abnormal high water temperature, Bio-monitoring system, Shell valve movement, Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, Early warning"

The contents of total polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannin in foxtail millet, proso millet, and Whinchal-susu tended to increase during germination. However, the total phenolic content of Whanggeumchal-susu greatly decreased by 48 hr of germination and then considerably increased, whereas the total flavonoid content of Whanggeumchal- susu greatly decreased during germination. Total tannin content of Whanggeumchal-susu greatly decreased by 36 hr of germination and then slowly increased. DPPH radical scavenging activity of Whanggeumchal-susu greatly decreased by 36 hr of germination and then remained constant, whereas those of other cereals did not greatly change during germination. These results indicate that there are some differences in the chemical components of three cereals during germination."
781,Dexmedetomidine for sedation of patients undergoing elective surgery under regional anesthesia,Ji A Song,2013,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: Dexmedetomidine may be useful as a sedative agent. However, it has been reported that dexmedetomidine decreases systemic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output in a dose-dependent manner. The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate dose of intravenously administered dexmedetomidine for sedation.
Methods: Forty-five American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II patients under spinal anesthesia received dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg intravenously as a loading dose. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups for maintenance dose: Group A (0.25 μg/kg/hr), Group B (0.50 μg/kg/hr), and Group C (0.75 μg/kg/hr). The hemodynamic variables and the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) score were recorded for all patients. The numbers of patients who developed hypotension, bradycardia, or inadequate sedation necessitating further drug treatment were also recorded.
Results: Systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and SpO2 were decreased, and RSS score was increased significantly at both 20 min and 40 min after injection of dexmedetomidine in the three study groups compared to baseline, without significant differences between the groups. The prevalence of hypotension, but not that of bradycardia or adjunctive midazolam administration, exhibited a positive correlation with the dose of dexmedetomidine.
Conclusions: Intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg followed by continuous administration at infusion rates of 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 μg/kg/hr produced adequate levels of sedation. However, there was a tendency for the incidence of hypotension to increase as the dose increased. To minimize the risk of hemodynamic instability, a dose of 0.25 μg/kg/hr may be the most appropriate for continuous administration of dexmedetomidine."

783,Longer waiting times for early stage cervical cancer patients undergoing radical hysterectomy are associated with diminished long-term overall survival,Kulisara Nanthamongkolkul,2015,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of surgical waiting time on clinical outcome in early stage cervical cancer.
Methods: The cohort consisted of 441 patients diagnosed with stages IA2–IB1cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection. The patients were divided into two groups based on surgical waiting time. The associations between waiting time and other potential prognostic factors with clinical outcome were evaluated.
Results: The median surgical waiting time was 43 days. Deep stromal invasion (hazard ratio [HR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 4.6; p=0.003) and lymph node metastasis (HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 6.7; p=0.026) were identified as independent prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival while no prognostic significance of surgical waiting time was found (p=0.677).
On multivariate analysis of overall survival (OS), only deep stromal invasion (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 5.0; p=0.009) and lymph node metastasis (HR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5 to 8.6; p=0.009) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. Although OS showed no significant difference between short (≤8 weeks) and long (>8 weeks) waiting times, multivariate analysis of OS with timevarying effects revealed that a waiting time longer than 8 weeks was associated with poorer long-term survival (after 5 years; HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 9.2; p=0.021).
Conclusion: A longer surgical waiting time was associated with diminished long-term OS of early stage cervical cancer patients."

To improve the quality of stored rice of the Korean japonica rice cultivar, we conducted a breeding program to develop near-isogenic rice without LOX-3 in the genetic background of Saenuri, a mega variety of Korea. In the first step of the breeding program, we used a donor parent of LOX-3 null, Daw Dam, and a recurrent japonica parent, Sindongjin, to develop HR27873-AC12 by backcross (BC1), color test for introgression of lox-3, and anther culture for rapid fixation. In the second step, we used the donor parent, HR27873-AC12, and the recurrent parent, Saenuri, to develop HR28896-31-3-1-1 by backcross (BC1), marker-assisted selection (MAS) for lox-3, and phenotypic selection (PS) for agronomic traits. Finally, in the third step, we developed HR30960-186-2-1-2-1 (Jeonju624), derived from a cross between Saenuri and HR28896-31-3-1-1, by MAS for lox-3 and PS with high selection pressure for agronomic characteristics. Jeonju624 was confirmed with the introgression of lox-3 by molecular marker. Jeonju624 was a mid-late maturing rice with similar agronomic characteristics to Saenuri, lodging tolerance with short culm, erect plant architecture, and resistance to bacterial blight and rice stripe virus. The yield components of Jeonju624 were mostly similar to Saenuri, except for the 1,000-grain weight of brown rice. The appearance of the grain of Jeonju624 was better than that of Saenuri, and the characteristics of cooked rice were similar to those of Saenuri. In the genetic background analysis using 406 KASP (Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR) markers, Jeonju624 was confirmed to be the near-isogenic line (NIL) of Saenuri with a 95.8% recovery rate. Jeonju624 is the NIL of Saenuri without LOX-3, and overcomes the linkage drag of Daw Dam with similar agronomic characteristics and genetic background to Saenuri. Jeonju624 can be utilized as a practical cultivar to improve the quality of stored rice, breeding material for the introgression of lox-3, and genetic material to elucidate the effect of introgressed genes."

Materials and Methods: Fifty-six adult female patients scheduled for elective total abdominal hysterectomy were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups according to fentanyl (group F, n=28) or remifentanil (group R, n=28) for postoperative analgesia. Patients in group F were given fentanyl intravenously with an infusion rate of fentanyl 0.5μg/kg/hr; group R was given remifentanil with an infusion rate of remifentanil 0.05μg/kg/ min for 2 days. Pain intensity at rest, occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), dizziness, pruritus, and respiratory depression were assessed 1 hr after arrival at the post-anesthesia care unit, at 6; 12; 24; and 48 hr post- operation and 6 hr post-infusion of the study drug. Pain was evaluated by using visual analogue scale (VAS; 0-10). The time that patients first requested analgesics was recorded as well as additional analgesics and antiemetics. Results: There were no significant differences in VAS, time to first postoperative analgesics, and additional analgesics between the 2 groups. The incidences and severities of PONV and opioid related side effects were not different between the groups; however, there were 3 episodes (10.7%) of serious respiratory depression in group R. Conclusion: Continuous infusion technique of remifentanil did not reveal any benefits compared to fentanyl. Furthermore, it is not safe for postoperative analgesia in the general ward."

S. costatum, C. didymus, A. tamarense 그리고 H. akashiwo는 인 공급원으로써 용존태 무기인(dissolved inorganic phosphorus; DIP) 이외에 phosphomonoester와 nucleotide 화합물을 이용하여 성장을유지할 수 있었다. S. costatum, C. didymus, A. tamarense 그리고 H. akashiwo의 APase 활성은 배양액내의 DIP가각각 0.30 μM, 0.33 μM, 2.04 μM과 0.63 μM에서 최초로 활성을 보였으며, 최대활성은 각각 0.01 pmol cell-1 hr-1, 0.11 pmol cell-1 hr-1, 1.63 pmol cell-1 hr-1와 0.19 pmol cell-1 hr-1였다. APase 활성은 종에 따라 다르게 나타났지만, 최대 활성은 DIP의 흡수속도보다도 높아 인이 제한된 환경에서 효과적으로 DOP를 가수분해하여 성장을 유지할 수 있을 것으로 보인다. 따라서 DOP의 이용능력은 적조 플랑크톤의 성장뿐만 아니라 종간경쟁에도 기여할 것으로 생각된다.Utilization of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and alkaline phosphatase (APase) activity by Skeletonema costatum, Chaetoceros didymus, Alexandrium tamarense and Heterosigma akashiwo under the phosphorus deficient condition were examined in the laboratory. S. costatum, C. didymus, A. tamarense and H. akashiwo could make use of phosphomonoester and nucleotide compounds for the growth of them as a phosphorus source.
APase activity of S. costatum, C. didymus, A. tamarense and H. akashiwo began to be activated at dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations less than 0.30 μM, 0.33 μM, 2.04 μM and 0.63 μM respectively,and their maximum APase activity were 0.01 pmol cell-1 hr-1, 0.11 pmol cell-1 hr-1, 1.63 pmol cell-1 hr-1 and 0.19pmol cell-1 hr-1, respectively. Although each phytoplankton species displayed different APase activity for DOP utilization, their maximum APase activities were higher than maximum phosphorus uptake rates, inferring that these species might be able to keep growing under DIP-limited conditions throught utilizing effectively the hydrolized product of DOP. This result also implies that utilization of DOP might contribute to not only the growth of red tide forming phytoplankton but also the interspecific competition among phytoplankton species in coastal environments."

방법: 고령화 연구패널조사(Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing)의 1차 기본 조사 자료와 2년마다 추적 조사를 통해 얻은 사망자 자료를분석하였다. 성별과 연령에 따라 악력을 삼분위로 구분하여 악력에따른 총 사망률 및 심장 질환, 뇌졸중 및 암 사망률과의 연관성을Cox proportional hazard model을 이용하여 분석하였다. 연령, 학력,결혼 상태, 취업유무, 가구 총소득, 규칙적 운동 여부, 흡연, 음주,body mass index, activities of daily living 유무, instrumental activities ofdaily living 유무, 우울증, 만성질환(고혈압, 당뇨, 암, 심장 질환, 뇌혈관 질환) 유무를 보정하였다.
결과: 남녀 모두에서 저악력군에 비해 고악력군에서 총 사망률 위험비가 감소하였다(남자: HR=0.580, 95% CI=0.478–0.704; 여자:HR=0.601, 95% CI=0.483–0.747). 암 사망률의 경우 남성에서 저악력군에 비해 중, 고악력군에서 위험비가 유의미하게 감소하였고(중악력군: HR=0.697, 95% CI=0.514–0.945; 고악력군: HR =0.589, 95%CI=0.427–0.812) 여성에서는 통계적으로 유의하지 않았다. 심장 질환에 의한 사망률은 남성에서는 저악력군에 비해 중, 고악력군에서위험비가 낮았으나(중악력군: HR=0.453, 95% CI=0.278–0.738; 고악력군: HR=0.538, 95% CI=0.332–0.871) 여성에서는 통계적으로 유의하지 않았다. 뇌졸중에 의한 사망률의 경우 남성에서는 공변수를보정하기 전에는 악력 증가에 따른 위험비 감소가 유의미하였으나변수 보정 이후에는 유의미하지 않았고 여성에서는 통계적으로 의미 있는 결과가 나오지 않았다.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between grip strength and mortality in middle aged and elderly Koreans.
Methods: Study subjects were selected from the participants of the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing from 2006 to 2016. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the association between grip strength, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality according to age and sex, after adjusting for covariates.
Results: The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was decreased in the high grip strength group (male: HR=0.580, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.478–0.704; female: HR=0.601, 95% CI=0.483–0.747) compared to the low grip strength group in both sexes. In male, cardiovascular mortality (middle group: HR=0.453, 95% CI=0.278–0.738; high group: HR=0.538, 95% CI=0.332–0.871) and cancer mortality (middle group: HR=0.697, 95% CI=0.514–0.945; high group: HR=0.589, 95% CI=0.427–0.812) were significantly lower in the middle and high grip strength groups compared to the low grip strength group. The HR for mortality due to stroke in male decreased significantly according to grip strength, but this became nonsignificant after adjusting for covariates. No association between cause-specific mortality and grip strength was found in female.
Conclusion: In this study, grip strength was inversely associated with all-cause mortality, with similar effects on cause-specific mortality due to heart disease and cancer in male. Grip strength is a useful predictor of health status, and further studies are needed to evaluate its clinical relevance in Koreans.Hand Strength, Mortality, Middle Aged, Aged, Korea"

Twenty-four healthy male Korean volunteers received one tablet containing pioglitazone HCl 15 mg in a 2 ×2 crossover study. There was a one-week washout period between the doses. Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone were monitored for over a period of 36 hr after administration by using a high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 36 hr (AUC0-36hr), maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax) and time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were complied from the plasma concentration-time data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was utilized for the statistical analysis of the parameters using logarithmically transformed AUC0-36hr and Cmax. The 90% confidence intervals of the AUC0-36hr ratio and the Cmax ratio for PirosTM/ActosTM‚ were log 0.8753-log 1.1286 and log 0.8669-log 1.1734, respectively. These values were within the acceptable bioequivalence intervals of log 0.80-log 1.25, recommended by KFDA. In all of these results, we concluded that the PirosTM‚ tablet was bioequivalent to the ActosTM‚ tablet, based on the rate and extent of absorption."
790,Influence of Midazolam and Glycopyrrolate on Intra-operative Body Temperature in Abdominal Surgical Patients,김은주 /Eun Ju Kim,2012,한국기초간호학회,"Purpose: Influence of benzodiazepine (midazolam)or cholinergic inhibitor (atropine or glycopyrrlate) on intra-operative body temperature remains unclear and controversial. This study compares intra-operative body temperature in 50 abdominal surgical patients under general anesthesia between the administration of midazolam and glycopyrrolate in combination, or glycopyrrolate alone. Methods: Patients who underwent abdominal surgery were recruited from September 2008 through October 2009 at Gachon University Gil hospital in Incheon. Core body temperature was measured in the right ear using a tympanic membrane thermometer at induction of general anesthesia and at 1 hr, 2 hr, and 3 hr after induction. Results: There were no differences in core body temperature at any measurement point between either patient group (F=1.08, p=.377). Core body temperature decreased throughout the 3 hr after induction in both groups (F=9.22, p<.001). Specially, core temperatures at induction of general anesthesia (p<.001), 1 hr (p<.001), 2 hr (p<.001), and 3 hr (p<.001) after induction were lower than before administration of midazolam and glycopyrrolate, or glycopyrrolate alone. Conclusion: We conclude that a cholinergic inhibitor (glycopyrrolate, 0.1 mg) therefore seems not to affect intra-operative body temperature of patients given a benzodiazepine (midazolam, 0.04 mg kg-1), and not to increase body temperature in patients not given a benzodiazepine during the 3 hr after the induction of general anesthesia. Intra-operative warming therefore is needed to prevent hypothermia in surgical patients who receive pre-operative administration of midazolam and/or glycopyrrolate."
791,"In vitro cytotoxicity of four calcium silicate-based endodontic cements on human monocytes, a colorimetric MTT assay",Sedigheh Khedmat,2014,대한치과보존학회,"Objectives: This study was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of four calcium silicate-based endodontic cements at different storage times after mixing. Materials and Methods: Capillary tubes were filled with Biodentine (Septodont), Calcium Enriched Mixture (CEM cement, BioniqueDent), Tech Biosealer Endo (Tech Biosealer) and ProRoot MTA (Dentsply Tulsa Dental). Empty tubes and tubes containing Dycal were used as negative and positive control groups respectively. Filled capillary tubes were kept in 0.2 mL microtubes and incubated at 37℃. Each material was divided into 3 groups for testing at intervals of 24 hr, 7 day and 28 day after mixing. Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cocultered with 24 hr, 7 day and 28 day samples of different materials for 24 and 48 hr. Cell viability was evaluated using an MTT assay. Results: In all groups, the viability of monocytes significantly improved with increasing storage time regardless of the incubation time (p < 0.001). After 24 hr of incubation, there was no significant difference between the materials regarding monocyte viability. However, at 48 hr of incubation, ProRoot MTA and Biodentine were less cytotoxic than CEM cement and Biosealer (p < 0.01).
Conclusions: Biodentine and ProRoot MTA had similar biocompatibility. Mixing ProRoot MTA with PBS in place of distilled water had no effect on its biocompatibility.
Biosealer and CEM cement after 48 hr of incubation were significantly more cytotoxic to on monocyte cells compared to ProRoot MTA and Biodentine."
792,"Study on Growth Curves of Longissimus dorsi Muscle Area, Backfat Thickness and Body Conformation for Hanwoo (Korean Native) Cows",J.H. Lee,2014,아세아·태평양축산학회,"The objective of this study was to estimate the parameters of Gompertz growth curves with the measurements of body conformation, real-time ultrasound longissimus dorsi muscle area (LMA) and backfat thickness (BFT) in Hanwoo cows. The Hanwoo cows (n = 3,373) were born in 97 Hanwoo commercial farms in the 17 cities or counties of Gyeongbuk province, Korea, between 2000 and 2007. A total of 5,504 ultrasound measurements were collected for the cows at the age of 13 to 165 months in 2007 and 2008. Wither height (HW), rump height (HR), the horizontal distance between the top of the hips (WH), and girth of chest (GC) were also measured. Analysis of variance was conducted to investigate variables affecting LMA and BFT. The effect of farm nested in location was included in the statistical model, as well as the effects of HW, HR, WH, and GC as covariates. All of the effects were significant in the analysis of variance for LMA and BFT (p<0.01), except for the HR effect for LMA. The two ultrasound measures and the four body conformation traits were fitted to a Gompertz growth curve function to estimate parameters. Upper asymptotic weights were estimated as 54.0 cm2, 7.67 mm, 125.6 cm, 126.4 cm, 29.3 cm, and 184.1 cm, for LMA, BFT, HW, HR, WH, and GC, respectively. Results of ultrasound measurements showed that Hanwoo cows had smaller LMA and greater BFT than other western cattle breeds, suggesting that care must be taken to select for thick BFT rather than an increase of only beef yield. More ultrasound records per cow are needed to get accurate estimates of growth curve, which, thus, helps producers select animals with high accuracy."
793,Human Papillomavirus Prevalence and Type Distribution Among 968 Women in South Korea,소경아 /So Kyeong A,2016,대한암예방학회,"Background: Geographic variation in the prevalence of carcinogenic types and human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype distribution is closely associated with the impact of HPV prophylactic vaccines. We determined the prevalence and distribution of HPV genotypes among healthy women in Korea.
Methods: This study included 968 healthy women who were examined at a health promotion center of the Korea University Guro Hospital between January and June 2013. Each participant had a Pap test and a HPV DNA test using the AnyplexTM II HPV 28 Detection system, which detects 19 high-risk HPVs (HR HPVs) and 9 low-risk HPVs (LR HPVs). Women with abnormal cytology and/or positivity for HR HPVs were referred to colposcopic biopsy.
Results: Overall HR HPV prevalence based on the assay was 33.7%. Among them, 225 women had single infection and 101 women had multiple infection. The most frequently occurring HR HPV types were 53 (6.5%), 52 (6.1%), 58 (4.8%), 16 (4.5%), and 68 (4.2%).
The most frequently occurring LR HPV types were 54 (5.4%), 70 (3.8%), 42 (3.6%), 61 (3.4%), and 44 (3.1%). The prevalence of HPV 16 was highest (17.6%) among women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and HPV 16 was strongly associated with a diagnosis of CIN2/3 (odds ratio = 20.5; 95% confidence interval: 3.9-107.1; P ＜ 0.0001).
Conclusions: HPV 53, 52, 58, 16, and 68 were common HR HPV types among healthy Korean women. HPV16 was the most common type in high-grade CIN lesions, as shown in most studies worldwide. The results might be useful information for cervical cancer prevention in South Korea.

This study showed that, 1 hr of KT is an effective treatment for decreasing pain and improving active range of motion and physical function at a 72-hr follow-up in patients with osteoarthritis."
795,일회성 저항성 운동 강도가 태권도 선수의 통증 자각도 및 근육기계적 속성에 미치는 영향,장종오 /Jang， Jong-O,2020,한국운동생리학회,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of acute resistance exercise intensity on pain perception, musclemechanical properties, oxygen saturation (OS) and lactate in taekwondo athletes.
METHODS: A total of 21 national and university taekwondo athletes participated in the study. The participants were randomly classifiedinto 70% of one repetition maximum (1 RM) (70% group, n=7), 30% of 1 RM (30% group, n=7), and 30% all-out group of 1RM (30%A group, n=7). We measured resting pain perception, muscle mechanical properties, lactate, heart rate (HR) and OS, andthose were measured immediately after exercise (IAE), 5- and 15-minute after recovery according to exercise intensity.
RESULTS: The 70% group showed that heat pain threshold (HPT) became numerically sensitive IAE compared to rest. Pain visualanalog scale (VAS) and HR increased significantly IAE compared to rest, and lactate increased significantly IAE, 5- and 15-minute afterexercise compared to rest, respectively. Dynamic stiffness (DS) decreased significantly in 15-minute after the exercise compared to IAE.
In 30% group case, pain VAS and HR increased significantly IAE compared to rest, and lactate increased significantly IAE, 5- and15-minute after exercise compared to rest, respectively. DS decreased significantly in 15-minute after the exercise compared to IAE.
The 30%A group showed that pain VAS and HR increased significantly IAE compared to rest. Lactate increased significantly IAE, 5-and 15-minute after exercise compared to rest, respectively. DS decreased significantly in immediately and 5-minute after the exercisecompared to rest, respectively. Frequency increased IAE compared to rest.
CONCLUSIONS: HPT, pain VAS, lactate, HR, and OS were found to be no difference between resistance exercise intensity. The intensityof 1 RM 30% all-out has been shown to contribute to muscle-adaptation effects of resistance exercise by further increasing muscletension and dynamic stiffness as much as 70% of 1 RM.Taekwondo, Resistance exercise, Pain perception, Muscle mechanical properties"

Methods: The cells were divided into two groups: As a control, the first was not treated with ACE, and the other was treated with ACE. Together with the cell viability, productions of nitric oxide (NO) and cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by treating of ACE were monitored.
Results:1. There was no decrease of the cell viability after 24 hr incubation, but a significant decrease after 48 hr incubation with all four concentrations (25, 100, 200, and 400 ㎍/㎖) of ACE.
2. A significant increase in the production of NO was observed in the concentrations above 50 ㎍/㎖ of ACE after 24 hr incubation.
3. Further, after 48 hr incubation, the critical concentration of ACE for the increase was reduced to 25 ㎍/㎖.
4. The production of IL-1β significantly increased with the ACE concentrations of 100 and 200 ㎍/㎖ after 24 hr incubation.
5. The production of IL-6 significantly increased with the ACE concentration of 200 ㎍/㎖ after 24 hr incubation.
6. A significant increase in the production of TNF-α was detected with ACE concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 ㎍/㎖after 24 hr incubation.
Conclusions: These show that ACE increases mouse macrophage NO production at concentrations above 50 ㎍/㎖,and the cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) at concentrations above 200 ㎍/㎖. These results suggest that ACE improves macrophage immune property."

Seasonal and spatial variations for monitored data were analyzed, and linear regression functions of CO_2 flux as environmental factors were estimated. CO_2 fluxes averaged between surface and atmosphere monitored in foreshore and paddy field at the winter season were shown -8 mgCO_2m%^(-2)hr^(-1) and -25 mgCO_2m^(-2)hr^(-1), respectively. CO_2 fluxes averaged between surface and atmosphere monitored in foreshore and paddy field at the summer season were shown 47 mgCO_2m^(-2)hr^(-1) and 117 mgCO_2m^(-2)hr^(-1), respectively. Thus, CO_2 was sunk from atmosphere to surface at the winter season and it was emitted from surface to atmosphere at the summer season.

798,Interaction of Escherichia coli K1 and K5 with Acanthamoeba castellanii Trophozoites and Cysts,Abdul Matin,2011,대한기생충학ㆍ열대의학회,"The existence of symbiotic relationships between Acanthamoeba and a variety of bacteria is well-documented. However, the ability of Acanthamoeba interacting with host bacterial pathogens has gained particular attention. Here, to understand the interactions of Escherichia coli K1 and E. coli K5 strains with Acanthamoeba castellanii trophozoites and cysts, association assay, invasion assay, survival assay, and the measurement of bacterial numbers from cysts were performed, and nonpathogenic E. coli K12 was also applied. The association ratio of E. coli K1 with A. castellanii was 4.3 cfu per amoeba for 1 hr but E. coli K5 with A. castellanii was 1 cfu per amoeba for 1 hr. By invasion and survival assays, E. coli K5 was recovered less than E. coli K1 but still alive inside A. castellanii. E. coli K1 and K5 survived and multiplied intracellularly in A. castellanii. The survival assay was performed under a favourable condition for 22 hr and 43 hr with the encystment of A. castellanii. Under the favourable condition for the transformation of trophozoites into cysts, E. coli K5 multiplied significantly. Moreover, the pathogenic potential of E. coli K1 from A. castellanii cysts exhibited no changes as compared with E. coli K1 from A. castellanii trophozoites. E. coli K5 was multiplied in A. castellanii trophozoites and survived in A. castellanii cysts. Therefore, this study suggests that E. coli K5 can use A. castellanii as a reservoir host or a vector for the bacterial transmission."
799,Cardiovascular Response During Submaximal Underwater Treadmill Exercise in Stroke Patients,"유지현 /Yoo, Jeehyun",2014,대한재활의학회,"Objective To evaluate the cardiovascular response during head-out water immersion, underwater treadmill gait, and land treadmill gait in stroke patients.Methods Ten stroke patients were recruited for underwater and land treadmill gait sessions. Each session was 40 minutes long; 5 minutes for standing rest on land, 5 minutes for standing rest in water or on treadmill, 20 minutes for treadmill walking in water or on land, 5 minutes for standing rest in water or on treadmill, and 5 minutes for standing rest on land. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were measured during each session. In order to estimate the cardiovascular workload and myocardial oxygen demand, the rate pressure product (RPP) value was calculated by multiplying systolic BP (SBP) by HR. Results SBP, DBP, mean BP (mBP), and RPP decreased significantly after water immersion, but HR was unchanged. During underwater and land treadmill gait, SBP, mBP, DBP, RPP, and HR increased. However, the mean maximum increases in BP, HR and RPP of underwater treadmill walking were significantly lower than that of land treadmill walking.Conclusion Stroke patients showed different cardiovascular responses during water immersion and underwater gait as opposed to standing and treadmill-walking on land. Water immersion and aquatic treadmill gait may reduce the workload of the cardiovascular system. This study suggested that underwater treadmill may be a safe and useful option for cardiovascular fitness and early ambulation in stroke rehabilitation."
800,Augmenter of Liver Regeneration Alleviates Renal Hypoxia-Reoxygenation Injury by Regulating Mitochondrial Dynamics in Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells,Xiao-hui Liao,2019,한국분자세포생물학회,"Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that constantly undergo fission and fusion processes that closely related to their function. Disruption of mitochondrial dynamics has been demonstrated in acute kidney injury (AKI), which could eventually result in cell injury and death. Previously, we reported that augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) alleviates renal tubular epithelial cell injury. Here, we gained further insights into whether the renoprotective roles of ALR are associated with mitochondrial dynamics. Changes in mitochondrial dynamics were examined in experimental models of renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR). In a model of hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) injury in vitro, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and mitochondrial fission process protein 1 (MTFP1), two key proteins of mitochondrial fission, were downregulated in the Lv-ALR + HR group. ALR overexpression additionally had an impact on phosphorylation of Drp1 Ser637 during AKI. The inner membrane fusion protein, Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1), was significantly increased whereas levels of outer membrane fusion proteins Mitofusin-1 and -2 (Mfn1, Mfn2) were not affected in the Lv-ALR + HR group, compared with the control group. Furthermore, the mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway was highly activated in the Lv-ALR + HR group. ALR overexpression led to suppression of HR-induced apoptosis. Our collective findings indicate that ALR gene transfection alleviates mitochondrial injury, possibly through inhibiting fission and promoting fusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane, both of which contribute to reduction of HK-2 cell apoptosis. Additionally, fission processes are potentially mediated by promoting tubular cell survival through activating the mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway."

We chemically synthesized KKHQ80109 (K09) and KKHQ80114 (K14), selective 5-HT2C agonists, with the purpose of developing therapeutic agents for the treatment of obesity. The objective of this work is to investigate pharmacokinetic parameters and bioavailability of K09 and K14 in rats given orally or intravenously. Oral administration of 20 mg/kg K09 results in 4.11 hr of the terminal half-life and 89.16 ng/ml of Cmax at 5.00 hr (Tmax). The terminal half-life of K14 was 3.83 hr with 215.81 ng/ml of Cmax at 3.33 hr (Tmax) after oral dosing of 20 mg/kg K14, indicating that K14 is more rapidly absorbed than K09. Bioavailability showed 0.17-0.21 for K09 and 0.19-0.23 for K14. Urinary excretion of parent K09 and K14 was less than 1%, indicating that K09 and K14 undergo very extensive hepatic metabolism."
802,Development of Sperm MTT Assay for Its Application in Boar Semen,Hyun-Yong Jang,2010,사단법인 한국동물생명공학회,"The MTT assay is one of superior evaluation methods widely used to analyze the viability of metabolically active cell. It can be used to determine the percentage of viable sperm through measurement of the reduction of MTT granules at mitochondria in sperm tail. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal condition of a simple and easy MTT assay to validate boar sperm viability and compare the accuracy of this test with microscopic examination.
The MTT reduction rate for sperm viability were analyzed in microtiter plates (96 well) from 1 hr to 5 hr incubation periods at 37℃ using spectrophotometer (microplate reader) at 550 nm wavelength. The remainder of semen sample was simultaneously examined to compare the correlation of accuracy between MTT assay and other sperm parameters.
Those sperm parameters were included the motility, survival rates, membrane integrity, mitochondria activity and acrosome integrity. The OD values of MTT assay (MTT reduction rates) did not greatly change at 1 hr to 5 hr incubation periods in different proportion of live and freeze-killed sperms (dead sperm). The MTT reduction rates or survival rates were decreased according to the different concentration of live and dead sperm. The linear regression at 1 hr and 4 hr incubation periods in sperm MTT assay was y = 291.55x—72.176 and y = 180.64x—44.569, respectively.
There are high correlation between 1 hr and 4 hr incubation periods (p<0.001). The results of MTT assay and other sperm parameters has a positive correlation (p<0.01 or 0.05). The correlation coefficients for MTT assay was 0.88115 for motility, 0.89868 for survival rates, 0.91722 for membrane integrity and 0.77372 for acrosome integrity,respectively. In conclusion, the MTT assay can be used as a reliable and efficient evaluation method for boar sperm viability. It can be use practical means to evaluate the quality of boar sperm by a fast, inexpensive and easy method"
803,Proliferation of Toxoplasma gondii Suppresses Host Cell Autophagy,이윤진,2013,대한기생충학ㆍ열대의학회,"Autophagy is a process of cytoplasmic degradation of endogenous proteins and organelles. Although its primary role is protective, it can also contribute to cell death. Recently, autophagy was found to play a role in the activation of host defense against intracellular pathogens. The aims of our study was to investigate whether host cell autophagy influences Toxoplasma gondii proliferation and whether autophagy inhibitors modulate cell survival. HeLa cells were infected with T. gondii with and without rapamycin treatment to induce autophagy. Lactate dehydrogenase assays showed that cell death was extensive at 36-48 hr after infection in cells treated with T. gondii with or without rapamycin. The autophagic markers, LC3 II and Beclin 1, were strongly expressed at 18-24 hr after exposure as shown by Western blotting and RT-PCR. However, the subsequent T. gondii proliferation suppressed autophagy at 36 hr post-infection. Pre-treatment with the autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), down-regulated LC3 II and Beclin 1. The latter was also down-regulated by calpeptin, a calpain inhibitor. Monodansyl cadaverine (MDC) staining detected numerous autophagic vacuoles (AVs) at 18 hr post-infection. Ultrastructural observations showed T. gondii proliferation in parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) coinciding with a decline in the numbers of AVs by 18 hr. FACS analysis failed to confirm the presence of cell apoptosis after exposure to T. gondii and rapamycin. We concluded that T. gondii proliferation may inhibit host cell autophagy and has an impact on cell survival."

We investigated the changes of plasma levels of NGF-β and the relationship to follow-up heart rate variability (HRV) after radiofrequencycatheter ablation (RFCA) of atrial fibrillation (AF).
Materials and Methods: This study included 147 patients with AF (117 men, 55.8±11.5 years, 106 paroxysmal AF) who underwent RFCA. The plasma levels of NGF-β were quantified using double sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay method before (NGF-βpre) and 1 hour after RFCA (NGF-βpost-1hr). HRV at pre-procedure (HRVpre), 3 months (HRVpost-3mo), and 1 year post-procedure (HRVpost-1yr) were analyzed and compared with plasma levels of NGF-β.
Results: 1) The plasma levels of NGF-β significantly increased after RFCA (20.05±11.09 pg/mL vs. 29.60±19.43 pg/mL, p<0.001). The patients who did not show increased NGF-βpost-1hr were older (p=0.023) and had greater left atrial volume index (p=0.028) than those with increased NGF-βpost-1hr. 2) In patients with NGF-βpre >18 pg/mL, low frequency components (LF)/high-frequency components(HF) (p=0.003) and the number of atrial premature contractions (APCs, p=0.045) in HRVpost-3mo were significantly higher than those with ≤18 pg/mL. 3) The LF/HF at HRVpost-3mo was linearly associated with the NGF-βpre (B=4.240, 95% CI 1.114–7.336, p=0.008) and the NGF-βpost-1hr (B=7.617, 95% CI 2.106–13.127, p=0.007). 4) Both NGF-βpre (OR=1.159, 95% CI 1.045–1.286, p=0.005) and NGF-βpost-1hr (OR=1.098, 95% CI 1.030–1.170, p=0.004) were independent predictors for the increase of LF/HF at HRVpost-3mo.
Conclusion: AF catheter ablation increases plasma level of NGF-β, and high plasma levels of NGF-βpre was associated with higher sympathetic nerve activity and higher frequency of APCs in HRVpost-3mo."

Methods: From July 2005 to October 2015, 36 patients with PRCC received IGRIS. We evaluated local progression-free survival (LPFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: The median follow up was 11.5 months. The 1- and 2-year LPFS rate was 34.9% and 20%, respectively. The multivariate analysis indicated recurrence site (central or pelvic wall) (hazard ratio [HR]=0.294; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.121–0.718), lesion volume (HR=2.898; 95% CI=1.139–7.372), D 90 (HR=0.332; 95% CI=0.130–0.850) were the independent factors affecting LPFS. The 1- and 2-year OS rate was 52.0% and 19.6%, respectively. The multivariate analysis suggested pathological type (HR=9.713; 95% CI=2.136–44.176) and recurrence site (HR=0.358; 95% CI=0.136–0.940) were the independent factors affecting OS. The dosimetric parameters of 33 patients mainly included D 90 (128.5±47.4 Gy), D 100 (50.4±23.7 Gy) and V 100 (86.7%±12.9%). When D 90 ≥105 Gy or D 100 ≥55 Gy or V 100 ≥91%, LPFS was extended significantly, but no significant difference for OS. The 79.2% of 24 patients with local pain were suffering from pain downgraded after radioactive 125I seed implantation. Conclusion: IGRIS implantation could be a safe and effective salvage treatment for PRCC after EBRT, which could markedly release the pain. Recurrence site, tumor volume and dose were the main factors affected efficacy. Compared with central recurrence, it was more suitable for patients with pelvic wall recurrent cervical cancer after EBRT..."

Biofilter의 안정화를 확인한 후 유입 농도와 공간속도를 변화시켜 처리효율을 측정하였으며, 침출수중의 액상 TMA, CODCr, NO3--N, NO2--N, NH4+-N, EPS(Extracellular Polymeric Substances)를 측정하여 생물학적인 영향과 처리효율에 대해 평가하였다. TMA의 유입농도를 약 10 ppm의 범위로 고정하고 SV(space velocity)를 120 hr-1에서 240 hr-1까지 증가시켜 TMA의 제거효율을 검토한 결과 120, 180 hr-1에서는 95% 이상, SV 240 hr-1에서는 최대 90%, 최소 80%의 제거효율을 얻어 최적 제거 공간 속도는 180 hr-1임을 확인 할 수 있었다. 또한, SV를 180 hr-1, 유입농도를 5～55 ppm까지 단계적으로 증가시켜 TMA의 제거효율을 검토한 결과 유입농도 10 ppm까지는 95%, 유입농도 10～30 ppm에서는 80%의 제거율을 보임을 알 수 있었고, 유입농도 40 ppm 이상에서는 제거효율이 급격히 감소하는 경향을 보여 TMA에 대한 임계 최대 제거 농도는 40 ppm임을 확인 할 수 있었다. Kinetic analysis를 통해 얻은 TMA의 최대 제거 속도(Vm)와 기질친화상수(KS)는 각각 14.3 g․m-3․h-1과 0.043 g․m-3로 나타났으며, 충격부하에 대한 미생물의 순응 기간은 100～150 hr 정도로 나타났다. 또한, 침출수중의 EPS 농도가 100～200 ppm의 범위에서 지속적으로 측정되어 반응기내에서 생물막이 지속적으로 생성되어짐을 확인 할 수 있었다.This study was conducted to investigate removal characteristics of gaseous trimethylamine(TMA) through biofilter packed with waste tire-chips. The sludge in this experiment was collected from an activated sludge operated in a wastewater treatment facility treating malodorous pollutants. The nominal amount of collected sludge was inoculated through packing materials in the filter. The removal efficiencies for varying concentrations and SVs(Space velocity) were assessed based on TMA, CODCr, NO3--N, NO2--N, NH4+-N and EPS(Extracellular Polymeric Substances) in leachate, since biofilter had been steady-stately operated. The influent concentration of 10 ppm of TMA was removed to approximately 95% regardless of changing SV at 120 and 180 hr-1, but it was lowered to 80 to 90% at SV 240 hr-1. As influent concentration was gradually increased from 5 to 55 ppm, the removal efficiencies of TMA were initially high for 95% in the range of 5 to 10 ppm, but lowered to 80% for 10 to 30 ppm. As a part of kinetic study for TMA decomposition, Vm(maximum substrate removal rate) and KS(substrate infinity coefficient) were 14.3 g․m-3․h-1 and 0.043 g․m-3, respectively while adapted period was shown in the range of 100 to 150 hr. Also, the EPS concentration was consistently observed from the leachate showing 100 to 200 ppm, which indicates that biofilm has been continuously formed and sustained throughout tire-chips packed reactor.Biofilter, Biofilm, Trimethylamine, Biodeodorization, Tire-chips"

808,Longer application of kinesio taping would be beneficial for exercise-induced muscle damage,김주영 /Kim Jooyoung,2016,한국운동재활학회,"Kinesio taping (KT) has been widely used to prevent muscle pain and to improve range of motion in clinical settings. However, no previous re-search has examined how long KT should be applied to muscle follow-ing damaging exercise. The aim of this study was to investigate the ef-fect of the duration of KT application on markers of muscle damage fol-lowing eccentric exercise. Thirty-two male subjects participated in the study and were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: con-trol (CON), KT-post, KT-30 min, or KT-24 hr. Eccentric exercise consisted of 2 sets of 25 contractions of elbow flexors using the non-dominant arm. Maximal isometric strength, muscle soreness (SOR), range of mo-tion, and creatine kinase activity were measured before,immediately after, and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr after exercise. The KT-24 hr group showed lesser muscle damage and a faster recovery time than the CON and KT-post groups. Both the KT-30 min and KT-24 hr groups showed lesser SOR than CON and KT-post groups. These findings sug-gested that prolonged application of KT had a positive effect on mark-ers of muscle damage."
809,Efficacy of Korean Multipurpose Contact Lens Disinfecting Solutions against Acanthamoeba castellanii,Eun-Kyung Moon,2016,대한기생충학ㆍ열대의학회,"Acanthamoeba keratitis has been increasing in recent years. Main risk factors are contact lens wear and their cleaning solutions. Most contact lens wearers use multipurpose disinfecting solutions (MPDS) for cleansing and disinfecting microorganisms because of its convenience. We determined amoebicidal effects of MPDS made in Korea and their cytotoxicity on human corneal epithelium cells. Fifteen commercial MPDS (A to O) were tested for their amoebicidal effects on Acanthamoeba castellanii trophozoites and cysts by using a most probable number (MPN) technique. Among them, 7 kinds of MPDS showed little or no amoebicidal effects for 24 hr exposure. Solutions A, B, G, H, L, and O showed positive amoebicidal effects, and solutions M and N killed almost all trophozoites and cysts after 24 hr exposure. However, 50%-N solution showed 56% cytotoxicity on human corneal epithelial cells within 4 hr exposure, and 50%-O solution also showed 62% cytotoxicity on human cells within 4 hr exposure. Solution A did not show any cytotoxicity on human cells. These results revealed that most MPDS made in Korea were ineffective to kill Acanthamoeba. The solutions having amoebicidal activity also showed high levels of cytotoxicity on human corneal epithelial cells. New formulations for improved MPDS that are amoebicidal but safe for host cells are needed to prevent Acanthamoeba keratitis."

In most cases, CH4 samples are collected in Tedlar bags and transported to laboratories for analysis. Considering this fact, in the present study, an attempt was made to find out how long samples can be stored in cases where they are kept in bags and transported as a preliminary study for sampling. According to the results of the experiment using simulated gases (1 ppm, 5 ppm, 10 ppm) in Tedlar bag, CH4 was safe up to 240 hr which is the full time. In the case of simulated gases are containing 4 kind gases (N2, CO2, CH4, and N2O). Field samples (samples of obtained by collecting combustion facilities’ exhaust gases) are known to contain highly reactive substances (for example NOx, SOx, and VOCs) and may affect each other. In the present study, one site sample was secured from each of a bituminous coal combustion facility and an LNG combustion facility and whether the concentrations of CH4 gas would change over time (24 hr, 96 hr, 144 hr, 192 hr) was checked. Since site samples could not be analyzed on the day of collection, an experiment was started 24 hr after the time point of sampling to analyze the samples. As with the results of analysis of the simulated gas (240 hr), the results of analysis using the site sample indicated that it could be stored for the full study period 192 hr. Therefore, it was judged that if 192 hr would be taken after sampling before the sample would be analyzed, the concentration value should be reliable."

Materials and Methods: Eighty-six patients with stage IIIC to IV gastric cancer were assessed for TP and DPD expression by immunohistochemistry. The association between CAPOX or SOX efficacy and TP/DPD expression was retrospectively analyzed.
Results: There were no significant differences in the objective remission rate (ORR, 52.27% vs. 47.62%; P>0.05), disease control rate (72.73% vs. 73.81%, P>0.05), progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.119; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.739–1.741; P=0.586), and overall survival (OS; HR, 0.855; 95% CI, 0.481–1.511; P=0.588) between CAPOX and SOX. A higher number of stage IV patients showed TP positivity, while DPD-positive patients predominantly showed intestinal type of gastric cancer. In TP-positive patients, the ORRs associated with CAPOX and SOX treatments were 57.14% and 38.10%, respectively; OS was better with CAPOX than with SOX (HR, 0.447; 95% CI, 0.179–0.978; P=0.046). Among DPD-positive patients, the SOX treatment-associated ORR (60.87%) was significantly higher than the CAPOX treatment-associated ORR (43.48%). Furthermore, SOX treatment resulted in better OS than did CAPOX treatment (HR, 2.020; 95% CI, 1.019–4.837; P=0.049).
Conclusions: No significant difference in clinical efficacy was found between CAPOX and SOX. TP-positive patients might respond better to CAPOX while DPD-positive patients may respond better to SOX. Our findings might serve as a guide for personalized chemotherapy for gastric cancer."

When OSA was defined at an ApneaLink AHI ≥5/hr, the positive correlating factors for OSA were age, male gender, and moderate to severe asthma. Conclusion: Moderate to severe asthma showed strong correlation with OSA when defined at an ApneaLink AHI ≥5/hr."
814,Different therapeutic associations of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with usual pneumonia,Hae-Young Lee,2021,대한내과학회,"Background/Aims: Although it is near concluded that renin-angiotensin system inhibitors do not have a harmful effect on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is no report about whether angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) offer any protective role. This study aimed to compare the association of ARBs and ACEIs with COVID-19-related mortality.
Methods: All patients with COVID-19 in Korea between January 19 and April 16, 2020 were enrolled. The association of ARBs and ACEIs with mortality within 60 days were evaluated. A comparison of hazard ratio (HR) was performed between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of pneumonia patients hospitalized in 2019 in Korea.
Results: Among 10,448 COVID-19 patients, ARBs and ACEIs were prescribed in 1,231 (11.7%) and 57 (0.6%) patients, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, and history of comorbidities, the ARB group showed neutral association (HR, 1.034; 95% CI, 0.765 to 1.399; p = 0.8270) and the ACEI groups showed no significant associations likely owing to the small population size (HR, 0.736; 95% CI, 0.314 to 1.726; p = 0.4810). When comparing HR between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia in 2019, the trend of ACEIs showed similar benefits, whereas the protective effect of ARBs observed in the retrospective cohort was absent in COVID-19 patients. Meta-analyses showed significant positive correlation with survival of ACEIs, whereas a neutral association between ARBs and mortality.
Conclusions: Although ARBs or ACEIs were not associated with fatal outcomes, potential beneficial effects of ARBs observed in pneumonia were attenuated in COVID-19."
815,The Regulation of AP-1 DNA Binding Activity by Long-term Nicotine Stimulation in Bovine Adrenal Medullary Chromaffin Cells: Role of Second Messengers,이진구 /LEE JIN KOO,2002,대한약리학회,"The signal pathways involved in the regulation of AP-1 DNA binding activity in long-term nicotine stimulated bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin (BAMC) cells have not been well characterized. To understand the involvement of second messengers in the regulation of AP-1 DNA binding activity, the present study was designed to define the time-course for inhibition of nicotine-induced responses by cholinergic antagonists, Ca 2+ and calmodulin (CaM) antagonists, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II inhibitor using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Nicotine (10μM) stimulation increased AP-1 DNA binding activity at 24 hr after treatment. Posttreatment with hexamethonium (1 mM) plus atropine (1μM) (HA), nimodipine (1μM), or calmidazolium (1μM) at 0.5, 3, and 6 hr after the nicotine treatment significantly inhibited the AP-1 DNA binding activity increased by long-term nicotine stimulation. However, posttreatment with HA, nimodipine, or calmidazolium at 9 or 12 hr after the nicotine treatment did not affect the nicotine-induced increase of AP-1 DNA binding activity. The pretreatment of BAMC cells with various concentrations of KN-62 inhibited the increase of AP-1 DNA binding activity induced by nicotine in a concentration-dependent manner. KN-62 (10μM) posttreatment beginning at 0.5, 3, or 6 hr after the nicotine treatment significantly inhibited the increase of AP-1 DNA binding activity. However, KN-62 posttreatment beginning at 9 or 12 hr after the nicotine treatment did not affect the increase of AP-1 DNA binding activity. This study suggested that stimulation (for at least 6 hr) of nicotinic receptors on BAMC cells was necessary for increase of AP-1 DNA binding activity, and activation of Ca 2+ , CaM, and CaMK II up to 6 hr at least seemed to be required for the increase of nicotine-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity"

818,Clinical Relevance of Time-to-positivity in BACTEC9240 Blood Culture System,박상혁 /Park. Sang Hyuk,2010,대한진단검사의학회,"Background : Continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (TTP). We evaluated the clinical relevance of TTP in the BACTEC9240 system (Becton-Dickinson, USA).
Methods : A total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. TTP was monitored from each of BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (BD) or Pediatric Plus/F and Lytic Anaerobic/F bottles, and the differential time-to-positivity (DTP) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined.
Results : The average TTP of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. While the average TTP values for Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for Candida spp., anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3 hr, respectively. The negative predictive values of TTP over 24 hr to predict Staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and S. pneumoniae among a-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecalis showed shorter TTP in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. DTP of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp.
Conclusions : TTP can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. The shorter TTP in anaerobic vials of certain Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. DTP is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp. (Korean J Lab Med 2010;30:276-83)"

This study aimed to investigate the risk of depression after taking 5-ARI and to quantify the risk using meta-analysis.
Materials and Methods: A total of 209,940 patients including 207,798 in 5-ARI treatment groups and 110,118 in control groups from five studies were included for final analysis. Inclusion criteria for finial analysis incudes clinical outcomes regarding depression risk in BPH or alopecia patients. Overall hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) for depression were analyzed.
Moderator analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed to determine whether HR or OR could be affected by any variables, including number of patients, age, study type, and control type.
Results: The pooled overall HRs for the 5-ARI medication was 1.23 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99–1.54) in a random effects model. The pooled overall ORs for the 5-ARI medication was 1.19 (95% CI, 0.95–1.49) in random effects model. The sub-group analysis showed that non-cohort studies had higher values of HR and OR than cohort studies. Moderator analysis using meta-regression showed that there were no variables that affect the significant difference in HR and OR outcomes.
However, in sensitivity analysis, HR was significantly increased by age (p=0.040).
Conclusions: Overall risk of depression after 5-ARI was significantly not high, however its clinical importance needs validation by further studies. These quantitative results could provide useful information for both clinicians and patients."
823,Long-term Prognosis of Mild to Moderate Aortic Stenosis and Coronary Artery Disease,Lee Wonjae,2021,대한의학회,"Background: There is an incomplete understanding of the natural course of mild to moderate aortic stenosis (AS). We aimed to evaluate the natural course of patients with mild to moderate AS and its association with coronary artery disease (CAD).
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 787 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate AS using echocardiography between 2004 and 2010. Cardiac death and aortic valve replacement (AVR) for AS were assessed.
Results: A median follow-up period was 92 months. Compared to the general population, patients with mild to moderate AS had a higher risk of cardiac death (hazard ratio [HR], 17.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.65–21.59; P < 0.001). Established CAD was detected in 22.4% and associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiac mortality (adjusted HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.04–2.53; P = 0.033). The risk of cardiac death was lower when patients were taking statin (adjusted HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41–0.98; P = 0.041), which was clear only after 7 years. Both patients with CAD and on statin tended to undergo more AVR, but the difference was not statistically significant (the presence of established CAD; adjusted HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.51–3.51; P = 0.214 and the use of statin; adjusted HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 0.76–4.58; P = 0.177).
Conclusion: Mild to moderate AS does not have a benign course. The presence of CAD and statin use may affect the long-term prognosis of patients with mild to moderate AS."
824,운동부하 흰쥐의 하지골격에서 과축적 당원의 이용양상,전춘배,1997,영남대학교 의과대학,"The aim of the present investigation has been to evaluate the depletion pattern of the supercompensated glycogen of hindlimb muscles during strenous exercise in rats. The plan of the maximizing muscle glycogen stores is based on the fact that a glycogen-depleted muscle by exercise will have an increased avidity for glycogen when exposed to a high carbohydrate diet. The glycogen concentration of soleus, red gastrocnemius and plantaris muscle, and liver was measured at 0, 30 and 60 minutes during treadmill exercise. The experimental animals were divided into 5 group - Normal(N), Control(C), 1Hour(1HR:after 1hour of glucose ingestion), 2Hour(2HR:after 2hour of glucose ingestion) and Exercise-1Hour(EX-1HR:glucose ingestion after 1 hour of preloading treadmill exercise)group - for glycogen storage study. The glycogen concentration of soleus, red gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles in N group was 4.57+/-0.34, 5.11+/-0.24 and 6.55+/-0.20 mg/gm wet wt., respectively. The glycogen concentration of soleus and red gastrocnemius in EX-1HR group were about 1.9 and 1.8 times than that of N group, respectively, but the concentration of plantaris was not higher than that of N group. The glycogen concentration of liver in N group was 41.0+/-1.47mg/gm wet wt. and the concentration of the overnight fasted C group wad only 2.9% of the value of N group. The level of glycogen concentration of liver in the other glucose ingested groups(1HR, 2HR, including EX-1HR) was within 19 - 32% of that of N group. The blood glucose concentration of EX-1HR group was higher than that of N group, the plasma free fatty acid concentration of C and 2HR group was higher than that of N group, and the plasma insulin concentration of EX-1HR group was higher than that of N group. The concentration of supercompensated glycogen of soleus and red gastrocnemius were rapidly decreased during 30 minutes of exercise but there was almost no changes of the concentration during the other 30 minutes of continuing exercise. The concentration of N group during 30 minutes of exercise was decreased but more slowly than those of EX-1HR group. The remaining level of glycogen after 60 minutes of exercise in EX-1HR group was higher than that of N group. Taken together, the mobilization of endogenous muscle glycogen at the first stage of exercise was proportioned to the intial level of glycogen concentration, and later on, when exercise continued, the muscle glycogen level was stabilized. And the remaining level of supercompensated muscle glycogen after 60 minutes of exercise was higher than that of normally stored glycogen level. The mobilization of the glycogen stroed in slow and fast oxidative muscle fibers is faster than in the fast glycolytic muscle fibers during strenous exercise"

Sulfur denitrification reaction in SDR is performed by autotrophic denitrification bacteria such as Thiobacillus denitrificans, which utilizes sulfur and converts nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) to nitrogen gas in anaerobic conditions. The findings were that denitrification using sulfur showed high rate of denitrification under conditions of pH 7.0~8.5. For relationship between the amount of alkalinity consumed in a denitrification reaction, approximately 3.3mg of alkalinity was consumed to denitrify 1 mg of nitrate-nitrogen.

Methods: Data from Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging 2006–2014 were assessed. A total of 10,254 participants were included at baseline, and survival rate was assessed biennially. Using cox proportional hazards model, the effect of health screening on mortality risk was investigated. Covariates were gender, depression, education, marital status, co-habitants, house income, social engagement, economic satisfaction, private health insurance, residence location, chronic diseases, and health behaviors (smoking, alcohol intake, regular exercise).
Results: At baseline 2006, 54.4% of participants didn’t undergo health screening. A hazard ratio (HR) for mortality risk of non-participants were 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21–1.53) after adjusting age and gender. Adding marital status and co-habitants to model 1 as covariates, HR was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.18–1.50) (model 2). Adding depression scores and socioeconomic vulnerabilities to model 2, HR was 1.29 s (95% CI, 1.14–1.45) (model 3). Adding chronic diseases to model 3, HR was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.14–1.48) (model 4). Finally, health behaviors have been added to model 4, HR was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.10–1.40) (model 5). In addition, the mortality risk increased as the cumulative number of missing health screenig increased accordingly.
Conclusion: Health screening was an independent factor to reduce mortality risk. Therefore, active encouragement to participate the health screening should be implemented to reduce all-cause mortality.Health Screening, All-Cause Mortality, Cox Proportional Hazard Model"

METHODS:Total of 4,239 subjects (53% women) aged ≥45 years, who participated in the Korean longitudinal study of aging (KLoSA) were included. Participants were classified into 4 categories from the lowest quartile to the highest quartile based on eCRF distribu¬tions. Korean version of mini-mental status examination (K-MMSE) was used to assessed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and severe cognitive impairment (SCI). Cox’s proportional regression analyses were used to determine the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of eCRF categories for having MCI and SCI. RESULTS: During 12-years of follow-up, there were 736 (17.4%) and 272 (6.4%) cases of incidence from MCI and SCI, respectively. In women, compared to the quartile 1 group (reference, HR=1), the quartile 4 group had significantly lower HRs of having incidence of MCI/SCI (HR=0.72, 95% CI=0.55-0.94, p=.015) and MCI (HR=0.73, 95% CI=0.54-0.99, p=.045). However, in men, eCRF was not associated with incidence of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS:The current findings suggest that eCRF may be an independent predictor of cognitive impairment in middle-aged and older women.Estimated cardiorespiratory fitness, Cognitive impairment, Middle-aged and older adults, Longitudinal study"
833,마이크로-나노버블 반응조를 이용한 미생물성장 동력학 계수의 추정에 관한 연구,한영립,2010,한국환경과학회,"The objectives of this research are to evaluate and compare the oxygen transfer coefficients(KLa) in both a general bubbles reactor and a micro-nano bubbles reactor for effective operation in sewage treatment plants, and to understand the effect on microbial kinetic parameters of biomass growth for optimal biological treatment in sewage treatment plants when the micro-nano bubbles reactor is applied. Oxygen transfer coefficients(KLa) of tap water and effluent of primary clarifier were determined. The oxygen transfer coefficients of the tap water for the general bubbles reactor and micro-nano bubbles reactor were found to be 0.28 hr-1 and 2.50 hr-1, respectively. The oxygen transfer coefficients of the effluent of the primary clarifier for the general bubbles reactor and micro-nano bubbles reactor were found be to 0.15 hr-1 and 0.91 hr-1, respectively. In order to figure out kinetic parameters of biomass growth for the general bubbles reactor and micro-nano bubbles reactor, oxygen uptake rates(OURs) in the saturated effluent of the primary clarifier were measured with the general bubbles reactor and micro-nano bubbles reactor. The OURs of in the saturated effluent of the primary clarifier with the general bubbles reactor and micro-nano bubbles reactor were 0.0294 mg O2/L․hr and 0.0465 mg O2/L․hr, respectively. The higher micro-nano bubbles reactor's oxygen transfer coefficient increases the OURs. In addition, the maximum readily biodegradable substrate utilization rates(Kms) for the general bubbles reactor and micro-nano bubbles reactor were 3.41 mg COD utilized/mg active VSS․day and 7.07 mg COD utilized/mg active VSS․day, respectively. The maximum specific biomass growth rates for heterotrophic biomass(μmax) were calculated by both values of yield for heterotrophic biomass(YH) and the maximum readily biodegradable substrate utilization rates(Kms). The values of μmax for the general bubbles reactor and micro-nano bubbles reactor were 1.62 day-1 and 3.36 day-1, respectively. The reported results show that the micro-nano bubbles reactor increased air-liquid contact area. This method could remove dissolved organic matters and nutrients efficiently and effectively."

835,환경 중 Thiram에 대한 초기위해성평가,김은주,2011,한국환경분석학회,"Thiram is a High Production Volume Chemical (HPV), mainly used as vulcanizing agents in the rubber industry, complexing agents and catalyser. In Korea, the production volume is about 604 tonnes/year as of 2006. The aim of this present investigation is to evaluate the toxic potential of thiram for the environment. In this study, Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) are used to get adequate information on the environment fate and pathways. In water, this substance is rapidly broken down by hydrolysis and photodegradation,especially under acidic conditions. It is not readily biodegradable and has a low bioaccumulation potential. 72 hr-EC_(50) (growth rate) and 72hr-EC_(50) (yield) for algae were 0.19 mg/L, 0.060 mg/L, respectively.
The 48hr-EC_(50) for daphnia was 0.036 mg/L and the 96hr-LC_(50) of acute toxicity to fish was 0.17 mg/L. From the acute toxicity value of algae, daphnia and fish, an assessment factor of 100 was used to determine the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). The PNEC was calculated to be 0.36 μg/L based on the 48hr-EC_(50)daphnia (0.036 mg/L). Based on these data, it is concluded that the substance possesses properties hazardous to the environment. Therefore, environment exposure assessment is recommended."
836,Cervical Vagal Nerve Stimulation Activates the Stellate Ganglion in Ambulatory Dogs,이경석,2015,대한심장학회,"Background and Objectives: Recent studies showed that, in addition to parasympathetic nerves, cervical vagal nerves contained significantsympathetic nerves. We hypothesized that cervical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) may capture the sympathetic nerves within the vagalnerve and activate the stellate ganglion.
Materials and Methods: We recorded left stellate ganglion nerve activity (SGNA), left thoracic vagal nerve activity (VNA), and subcutaneouselectrocardiogram in seven dogs during left cervical VNS with 30 seconds on-time and 30 seconds off time. We then compared theSGNA between VNS on and off times.
Results: Cervical VNS at moderate (0.75 mA) output induced large SGNA, elevated heart rate (HR), and reduced HR variability, suggestingsympathetic activation. Further increase of the VNS output to >1.5 mA increased SGNA but did not significantly increase the HR, suggestingsimultaneous sympathetic and parasympathetic activation. The differences of integrated SGNA and integrated VNA between VNSon and off times (ΔSGNA) increased progressively from 5.2 mV-s {95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25–9.06, p=0.018, n=7} at 1.0 mA to13.7 mV-s (CI: 5.97–21.43, p=0.005, n=7) at 1.5 mA. The difference in HR (ΔHR, bpm) between on and off times was 5.8 bpm (CI: 0.28–11.29, p=0.042, n=7) at 1.0 mA and 5.3 bpm (CI 1.92 to 12.61, p=0.122, n=7) at 1.5 mA.
Conclusion: Intermittent cervical VNS may selectively capture the sympathetic components of the vagal nerve and excite the stellateganglion at moderate output. Increasing the output may result in simultaneously sympathetic and parasympathetic capture."
837,Assessment of Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring for Statin Treatment Strategy according to ACC/AHA Guidelines in Asymptomatic Korean Adults,한동희,2017,연세대학교의과대학,"Purpose: The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) cholesterol management guidelinesadvocate the use of statin treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease. We aimed to assess the usefulness of coronary artery calcium (CAC) for stratifying potential candidates of statin use among asymptomatic Korean individuals.
Materials and Methods: A total of 31375 subjects who underwent CAC scoring as part of a general health examination were enrolledin the current study. Statin eligibility was categorized as statin recommended (SR), considered (SC), and not recommended(SN) according to ACC/AHA guidelines. Cox regression analysis was employed to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidentialintervals (CI) after stratifying the subjects according to CAC scores of 0, 1–100, and >100. Number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one mortality event during study follow up was calculated for each group.
Results: Mean age was 54.4±7.5 years, and 76.3% were male. During a 5-year median follow-up (interquartile range; 3–7), there were 251 (0.8%) deaths from all-causes. A CAC >100 was independently associated with mortality across each statin group after adjusting for cardiac risk factors (e.g., SR: HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.07–2.38; SC: HR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.09–8.13, and SN: HR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.08–9.17). Notably, patients with CAC >100 displayed a lower NNT in comparison to the absence of CAC or CAC 1–100 in SC and SN groups.
Conclusion: In Korean asymptomatic individuals, CAC scoring might prove useful for reclassifying patient eligibility for receiving statin therapy based on updated 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines."
838,Lymphadenectomy for primary ovarian cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Tatsuyuki Chiyoda,2020,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: To assess the effectiveness of lymphadenectomy at primary debulking surgery(PDS) on the survival of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
Methods: We searched PubMed, Ichushi, and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlledtrials (RCTs) and retrospective cohort studies comparing survival of women with EOCundergoing lymphadenectomy at PDS with that of women without lymphadenectomy wereincluded. We performed a meta-analysis of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival(PFS), and adverse events.
Results: For advanced-stage EOC, 2 RCTs including 1,074 women and 7 cohort studiescomprising 3,161 women were evaluated. Meta-analysis revealed that lymphadenectomy wasassociated with improved OS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.70–0.90). However, meta-analysis of 2 RCTs revealed no significant difference in OS betweenthe lymphadenectomy and no-lymphadenectomy groups (OS: HR=1.02; 95% CI=0.85–1.22).
For early-stage EOC, 1 RCT comprising 268 women and 4 cohort studies comprising 14,228women were evaluated. Meta-analysis showed that lymphadenectomy was associatedwith improved OS (HR=0.75; 95% CI=0.68–0.82). A RCT of early-stage EOC reported thatlymphadenectomy was not associated with improved OS (HR=0.85; 95% CI=0.49–1.47).
Surgery-related deaths were similar in both groups (risk ratio [RR]=1.00; 95% CI=0.99–1.01);however, blood transfusion was required less frequently in the no-lymphadenectomy group(RR=0.74; 95% CI=0.63–0.86).
Conclusions: Meta-analysis of RCTs and observational studies suggest thatlymphadenectomy was associated with improved OS in advanced- and early-stage EOC.
However, results from RCTs demonstrate that lymphadenectomy was not associated withimproved OS in advanced- and early-stage EOC."
839,Postoperative renal function in patients is unaltered after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy,안재현,2011,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: Pneumoperitoneum with an intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of 14 mmHg is known to decrease renal function. Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) requires an IAP of more than 15 mmHg for operation.
Therefore, we retrospectively investigated whether patients who underwent RARP experienced renal insufficiency during the postoperative period (at postoperative days 7 and 30).
Methods: One hundred patients who underwent RARP were enrolled in this study. Preoperative serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr) levels were measured. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) was calculated using the Cockcroft and Gault formula. CrCl was calculated at 1 day before surgery (baseline), 2 hr postoperatively, and at 1,3, 7, and 30 days postoperatively (POD 1, POD 3, POP 7, and POD 30). Patients were assigned to abnormal CrCl (n =52) or normal CrCl groups (n = 48) on the basis of these measurements.
Results: Significant inter-group differences in BUN, Cr, and CrCl were observed at all postoperative time points. BUN and Cr decreased significantly at postoperative 2 hr and POD 1, 3, and 7 versus baseline in both groups, whereas CrCl increased significantly at postoperative 2 hr and POD 1, 3, and 7 versus baseline in both groups. However, BUN, Cr,and CrCl were similar at POD 30 and preoperatively in the two groups.
Conclusions: RAPR, which requires an IAP of 15-20 mmHg for more than 4 hr, does not induce renal dysfunction during the postoperative period, and even in those patients with an abnormal CrCl."
840,토양유실 저감을 위한 지표피복재 적용,원철희,2011,한국물환경학회,"The objective of this research was to experimentally test the effect of rice straw mats on the reduction of runoff, sediment and discharge under a laboratory scale with different rainfall intensity and slopes. We used the small runoff plots of 1 m × 1 m × 0.65 m (L×W×H) in size were filled with loamy sand. Experimental treatments were bare (control), rice straw mats + PAM(SP), rice straw mats + PAM + sawdust(SPS) and rice straw mats + PAM + rice husks(SPR); slope of 10% or 20%; and rainfall intensity of 30 or 60 mm/hr. Runoff volume and coefficient from covered plots were significantly lower than those from control plots. Under the 30 mm/hr and 10% simulations, average runoff coefficient of covered plots decreased more than 92%. Under 60 mm/hr and 20% simulations, the ratios were between 39.8~58.1%. Under the condition of 30 mm/hr rainfall and 10% slope, sediment discharge from covered plots was practically zero. And at 20% plots, sediment reduction ratio was more than 95%. Under the condition of 60 mm/hr rainfall, sediment reduction ratio of 10 and 20% plots ranged between 86.3~95.3% and between 79.8~86.5%, respectively. The differences in initial runoff time, runoff and sediment discharge among different cover materials were not significant. Rainfall intensity showed higher impact on initial runoff time, runoff, and sediment discharge than slope. It was also shown that even if runoff reduction by surface cover were low, sediment discharge reduction could be very significant and contribute to improve the water quality of streams in sloping agricultural regions. It was concluded that the use of straw mat and PAM on sloping agricultural fields could reduce soil erosion and muddy runoff significantly and help improve the water quality and aquatic ecosystem in receiving waters."
841,C-reactive Protein and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate Discrepancies and Variations after Intravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy in Kawasaki Disease,"이윤숙 /Lee, Youn-Sook",2016,대한소아감염학회,"Purpose: We undertook this study to investigate discrepancies in C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values, and variations following intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in Kawasaki disease (KD).
Methods: A total of 123 KD patients were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were treated with IVIG 2 g/kg at 2 to 9 days after disease onset. We obtained white blood cell (WBC) count, percentage of neutrophils (% neutrophils), CRP, ESR, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) values before and 48 to 72 hours after IVIG treatment. Discrepancy was defined as CRP ≥10 mg/dL and ESR <50 mm/ hr (Group 1), or CRP <10 mg/dL and ESR ≥50 mm/hr (Group 2).
Results: Thirty-six of 123 subjects (29.2%) had a discrepancy: 25 (20.3%) in Group 1 and 11 (8.9%) in Group 2. In Group 1, 15 patients (60%) had fever for <5 days (early presenter) and 10 (40%) had fever for ≥5 days (late presenter). There were six early presenters (55%) and five late presenters (45%) in Group 2. Late presenters had higher ESR than early presenters (34.3±21.0 mm/hr vs. 26.3±19.3 mm/hr, P=0.029). After IVIG treatment, elevated WBC count, % neutrophils, CRP, and NT-proBNP levels normalized. In contrast, ESR increased from 37.4±21.9 mm/hr to 48.0±22.7 mm/hr (n=36, P=0.051).
Conclusions: A discrepancy may be related to the duration of fever. Due to discrepancies in CRP and ESR values in acute KD, both should be measured to assess the degree of inflammatory activity before IVIG treatment. After IVIG treatment, the ESR should not be used as a marker of response to therapy in KD.목적: 가와사끼병에서 C-반응 단백질(CRP)과 적혈구 침강속도(ESR)의 불일치 및 정맥내 면역글로불 린(IVIG) 치료 후의 변화를 보고자 하였다.
방법: 총 123명의 가와사끼병 환자의 의무기록를 후향적으로 분석하였다. 염증성 지표들을 IVIG 치료 전과 치료 후 48-72시간에 검사하였다. 불일치는 CRP ≥10 mg/dL와 ESR <50 mm/hr, 또는 CRP <10 mg/dL와 ESR ≥50 mm/hr로 정의하였고 전자를 1 군으로, 후자를 2군으로 구분하였다.
결과: 전체 123명 중 36명(29.2%)에서 불일치를 보였는데 1군은 25명(20.3%)이었고, 2군은 11명 (8.9%)이었다. 1군에서 15명은 발열기간이 5일 미만(초기 발현자)이었고, 10명은 5일 이상(후기 발현 자)이었다. 2군에서는 6명이 초기 발현자, 5명이 후기 발현자였다. ESR 값은 초기 발현자보다 후기 발현자에서 더 높았다(26.3±19.3 mm/hr vs. 34.3±21.0 mm/hr, P=0.029). IVIG 치료 후에는 증가된 CRP를 포함한 여러 염증성 지표들은 정상으로 돌아왔으나 ESR은 오히려 37.4±21.9 mm/hr에서 48.0±22.7 mm/hr로 증가하였다(n=36, P=0.051).
결론: CRP와 ESR 값의 불일치는 발열기간과 연관이 있으리라 추정된다. 이 두 중요 염증성 지표가 불일치할 수 있으므로 급성 가와사끼병의 치료 전 질병의 염증 활성도를 평가하기 위해서는 이 두 지표를 동시에 검사하는 것이 필요하며, IVIG 치료 후의 ESR은 치료 반응의 지표로 적합하지 않다."
842,A Study of Relationship of Atheroembolic Risk Factors with Postoperative Recovery in Renal Function after Partial Nephrectomy in Patients Staged T1-2 Renal Cell Carcinoma during Median 4-Year Follow-up,김성한 /KIM Sung Han,2016,대한암학회,"Purpose The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship of atheroembolic risk factors with postoperative recovery of renal function after on-clamp partial nephrectomy (PN) with warm ischemia in patients with staged T1-2 renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Materials and Methods A total of 234 patients from 2004 to 2012 were included, and their clinicopathologic and operative parameters, including atheroembolic risk factors were reviewed retrospectively. Renal function, as determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and measure- ment of serum creatinine level (Cr) at each scheduled follow-up for a median four years, was compared between the high-risk (HR) group (n=49, ! five risk factors) and the low-risk (LR) group (n=185, < five risk factors).
Results Except for baseline renal function and number of risk factors for atheroembolism, differ- ences in characteristics between groups were comparatively insignificant. At 3 months after the operation, Cr and eGFR differed significantly between the two groups (p < 0.05), but no differences were observed afterward. Significant deterioration from baseline in Cr and eGFR was observed in both groups at 1 month after the operation, with a greater change in the HR group (p < 0.05). From measurement to measurement, significantly faster deterioration in Cr and eGFR was observed in the HR group than in the LR group until 6 months after the operation (Cr: LR, 0.02 mg/dL and HR, 0.13 mg/dL; eGFR: LR, 1.50 mL/min/1.73 m2 and HR, 6.38 mL/min/1.73 m2; p < 0.05).
Conclusion The presence of atheroembolic risk factors may negatively influence postoperative recovery of renal function after PN in patients with localized RCC."
843,Recurred Intracranial Meningioma: A Retrospective Analysis for Treatment Outcome and Prognostic Factor,류현승,2017,대한뇌종양학회,"Background In this study, we aimed to compare repeated resection and radiation treatment, such as Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) or conventional radiotherapy (RT), and investigate the factors influencing treatment outcome, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and complication rates.
Methods We retrospectively reviewed 67 cases of recurred intracranial meningiomas (repeated resection: 36 cases, radiation treatment: 31 cases) with 56 months of the median follow-up duration (range, 13-294 months).
Results The incidence of death rate was 29.9% over follow-up period after treatment for recurred meningiomas (20/67). As independent predictable factors for OS, benign pathology [hazard ratio (HR) 0.132, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.048-0.362, p<0.001] and tumor size <3 cm (HR 0.167, 95% CI 0.061-0.452, p<0.001) were significantly associated with a longer OS. The incidence of progression rate was 23.9% (16/67). Only treatment modality was important for PFS as an independent predictable factor (GKRS/RT vs. open resection; HR 0.117, 95% CI 0.027-0.518, p<0.005). The complication rate was 14.9% in our study (10/67). Larger tumor size (≥3 cm, HR 0.060, 95% CI 0.007- 0.509, p=0.010) was significant as an independent prognostic factor for development of complications.
Although treatment modality was not included for multivariate analysis, it should be considered as a predictable factor for complications (p=0.001 in univariate analysis).
Conclusion The role of repeated resection is questionable for recurred intracranial meningiomas, considering high progression and complication rates. Frequent and regular imaging follow-up is required to detect recurred tumor sized as small as possible, and radiation treatment can be a preferred treatment."
844,Contrasting Prognostic Effects of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte Density in Cardia and Non-cardia Gastric Adenocarcinomas,김형일 /Hyoung-Il Kim,2020,대한위암학회,"Purpose: This study sought to investigate the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in relation to tumor location within the stomach.
Materials and Methods: The densities and prognostic significance of TIL subsets were evaluated in 542 gastric cancer patients who underwent gastrectomy. Immunohistochemical staining for CD3, CD4, CD8, forkhead/winged helix transcription factor (Foxp3), and granzyme B was performed.
Results: Cardia cancer was associated with significantly lower densities of CD8 T-cells and higher densities of Foxp3 and granzyme B T-cells than non-cardia tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that advanced age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.023; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.006–1.040), advanced T classification (HR, 2.029; 95% CI, 1.106–3.721), lymph node metastasis (HR, 3.319; 95% CI, 1.947–5.658), low CD3 expression (HR, 0.997; 95% CI, 0.994–0.999), and a high Foxp3/CD4 ratio (HR, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.001–1.012) were independent predictors of poor overall survival in cardia cancer patients. In non-cardia cancer patients, total gastrectomy (HR, 2.147; 95% CI, 1.507–3.059), advanced T classification (HR, 2.158; 95% CI, 1.425–3.266), lymph node metastasis (HR, 1.854; 95% CI, 1.250–2.750), and a low Foxp3/CD4 ratio (HR, 0.978; 95% CI, 0.959–0.997) were poor prognostic factors for survival.
Conclusions: The densities and prognostic effects of TILs differed in relation to the location of tumors within the stomach. The contrasting prognostic effects of Foxp3/CD4 ratio in cardia and non-cardia gastric cancer patients suggests that clinicians ought to consider tumor location when determining treatment strategies."
845,나노칼슘이 장내 칼슘 흡수 및 골교체율에 미치는 영향,강지현 /Jee Hyun Kang,2011,대한골다공증학회,"Objectives: We compared the effects of two different nano-sized calcium supplements (synthesized by wet-chemical method or the dry-grinding method of calcium carbonate) and one micro-sized calcium supplement (calcium carbonate) on intestinal absorption and bone turnover in 20 young women.
Materials & Methods: This study was carried out with a three week cross-over design. The subjects ingested one of three different calcium supplements (1 dose of 500 mg Ca++) at 8 AM, which was repeated three times weekly. Serum and urine samples were collected before and after the calcium load using a time table (serum sampling 0, 2 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr after loading; urine sampling 0, 4 hr, 8 hr after loading).
Results: Serum ionized calcium and parathyroid hormone concentrations significantly changed in response to all calcium supplements loading, the difference among calcium supplements was not significant. However, the postload urinary excretion of calcium and the N-telopeptide/creatinine ratio were significantly different among three calcium supplement over time by repeated measured ANOVA.
Conclusions: The results of this study suggest the effect of nano-sized calcium supplements synthesized by the wet-chemical method is superior to the other calcium supplements in intestinal calcium absorption and bone turn-over."

However some patients achieve long term survival after chemotherapy. Here we investigated the prognostic factors affecting long term survival for metastatic gastric cancer after chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 176 metastatic gastric cancer patients who received chemotherapy at the Kosin University Gospel Hospital from 2005 to 2010. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic factors of long term survival. Results: Overall survival time was 9 months and 5-year survival rate was 2.6%. Multivariate analysis revealed distant lymph nodes metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; P=0.008), initial low albumin level (＜3 g/dL) (HR, 2.64; P=0.003), patients ＜40 years (HR, 2.12; P=0.032), and poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG], 2) (HR, 1.66; P=0.008) as significant factors of poor survival. 12 patients with metastatic gastric cancer survived more than 36 months. All of them had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and no one was ＜40 years at the time of diagnosis. In addition, there were no lung metastasis and bone metastasis. Conclusions: These results suggest that better performance status and the presence of only distant lymph nodes metastasis are favorable factors for long term survival of metastatic gastric cancer. Macroscopically scirrhous type of tumors, lung, bone or peritoneal metastasis and age of ＜40 years are poor prognostic factors for long term survival of metastatic gastric cancer.

848,Screening and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection among Healthcare Workers at a Referral Hospital in Korea,박세윤 /Se Yoon Park,2019,대한감염학회,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have a high risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection. Since August 2017, Korea has mandated the testing of latent TB infection (LTBI) and recommended treatment from HCWs at medical institutions. However, the acceptance/completion rate and adverse events of LTBI treatment have not been analyzed.
Materials and Methods: From February to August 2017, we conducted a retrospective study at a referral university hospital in Korea, to screen the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) tests conducted for all HCWs for detecting and treating LTBI. HCWs diagnosed with LTBI were offered a 9-month isoniazid (9H), 3-month isoniazid/rifampin (3HR), or 4-month rifampin regimen. We investigated the acceptance/completion rate, adverse events, and causes of discontinuation or change in LTBI medication. A major adverse event was one wherein a patient had any adverse event ≥grade 3 causing LTBI treatment interruption.
Results: Of the 1,538 HCWs, 1,379 underwent IGRA testing for LTBI. Among them, 13.6% (187/1,379) tested positive and 73.3% (137/187) received treatment. The overall completion rate was 97.8% (134/137). HCWs were significantly more likely to complete first-line therapy with 3HR than with 9H (91.4% vs. 76.7%, P = 0.02). The most common major adverse event was hepatotoxicity (n = 7), followed by thrombocytopenia (n = 1) and anaphylactic shock (n = 1). Hepatotoxicity and hepatotoxicity (≥ grade 2) were more frequent in 9H than in 3HR (39.5% vs. 17.2%, P = 0.006 and 18.6% vs. 3.7%, P = 0.005, respectively). The median time to hepatotoxicity was 96 days (interquartile range, 20 – 103 days).
Conclusion: Completion of first-line therapy for LTBI is more likely with 3HR than with 9H. This might be related to the development of hepatotoxicity after around 3 months of treatment. Anaphylactic shock and platelet count should be carefully monitored in those receiving rifampin-containing regimens."

METHODS: Data from the 2006 Korean longitudinal study of aging (KLoSA) involving 348 study participants aged 60 years and older (58.0% women) was analyzed in this study. CRF was estimated with sex- and age-specific algorithms developed by the fitness registry and the importance of exercise national database (FRIEND). Participants were classified into lowest 25% (Q1), lower 25% (Q2), middle 25% (Q3), and highest 25% (Q4) on the basis of individual eCRF distributions. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) according to eCRF levels.
RESULTS: During 7.8±3.2-year follow-up period, a total of 175 deaths occurred from all causes. Cox regression analysis showed that HR of all-cause mortality was 0.686 (95% CI, 0.474-0.991, p=.045) for Q2, 0.382 (95% CI, 0.253-0.575, p<.001) for Q3, and 0.248 (95% CI, 0.155-0.397, p<.001) for Q4 compared to Q1 as reference (HR=1). The HR of Q4 for all-cause mortality remained significant even after adjustments for covariates, including age and marital status.
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that high eCRF is associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality in underweight older adults.Cardiorespiratory fitness, Mortality, Older adults, Underweight"
850,"The Diagnostic Accuracy, Image Quality and Radiation Dose of 64-Slice Dual-Source CT in Daily Practice: a Single Institution’s Experience",문준호,2011,대한영상의학회,"Objective: We wanted to evaluate the image quality, diagnostic accuracy and radiation exposure of 64-slice dual-source CT (DSCT) coronary angiography according to the heart rate in symptomatic patients during daily clinical practice.
Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective search for the DSCT coronary angiography reports of 729 consecutive symptomatic patients. For the 131 patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography, the image quality, the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV] and negative predictive value [NPV] for detecting significant stenosis ≥ 50% diameter) and the radiation exposure were evaluated. These values were compared between the groups with differing heart rates (HR): mean HR < 65 or ≥ 65 and HR variability (HRV) < 15 or ≥ 15.
Results: Among the 729 patients, the CT reports showed no stenosis or insignificant coronary artery stenosis in 72%, significant stenosis in 26% and non-diagnostic in 2%. For the 131 patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography, 95% of the patients and 97% of the segments were evaluable, and the overall per-patient/per-segment sensitivity, the perpatient/per-segment specificity, the per-patient/per-segment PPV and the per-patient/per-segment NPV were 100%/90%, 71%/98%, 95%/88% and 100%/97%, respectively. The image quality was better in the HR < 65 group than in the HR ≥ 65 group (p = 0.001), but there was no difference in diagnostic performance between the two groups. The mean effective radiation doses were lower in the HR < 65 or HRV < 15 group (p < 0.0001): 5.5 versus 6.7 mSv for the mean HR groups and 5.3 versus 9.3 mSv for the HRV groups.
Conclusion: Dual-source CT coronary angiography is a highly accurate modality in the clinical setting. Better image quality and a significant radiation reduction are being rendered in the lower HR group."

852,고성과 작업시스템과 조직성과간의 관계: 조직문화의 조절효과를 중심으로,이명주 /Myeongju， Lee,2015,한국생산성학회,"Most studies of SHRM have focused on testing the relationship between high performance work systems(HPWSs) and performances, and most have found a positive relationship between HPWSs and organizational performance. Some studies have argued that examining the mechanism of this relationship is critical to developing theory.
The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between high HPWSs and the organization's performance. Also, it attempts to show the moderating effects of organizational culture in the HPWSs-organization's performance link. Prior studies have found a positive effect of HPWS on firm performance. Drawing on the AMO model, we hypothesized that three modes of HR systems differently contribute to organizational performances(sales, job satisfaction). Also, based on the prediction from CVF model, we expected the moderating role of organizational culture in relation to the HPWSs and organizational performance.
To test the effects, we used HCCP data collected by the Korea Human Resources Development Institute Survey. HR managers were questioned on HRM practices and employees on job satisfaction and organizational culture. This study employed the 4th data for HR systems collected in 2011 and the 5th data for organizational performance collected in 2013. The result of the present study supported the hypothesized moderating effect of organizational culture in the HPWSs-performance relationship. Specifically, the result showed that motivation enhancing HR system and opportunity enhancing HR system were significant factors of organizational performance. Also, we could find some supporting evidences for moderating effect of organizational culture in HPWSs on performances.
This paper highlights the importance of organization’s context in utilizing HR systems.
The model we propose provides implication of the relationship between HPWSs and organizational performance by specifying how HPWSs influence the organizational context. This study offers critical insight into the mechanism of the HPWSs research field. From a theoretical perspective, this study emphasize the need to take the situational factors in organizations (i.e., culture) into SHRM literatures. Specifically, the result of the study suggests that organizational culture can influence the relationship between HPWSs and performance in significant degrees, thus provides a rationale to introduce organizational situational variables to SHRM studies. In practical senses, the result of the study can offer insights to the organizations which manage diverse arrays of HR systems.
Also, the study highlights the importance of organizational culture in implementing HR practices. Limitations of this study are described in terms of reverse causality, sample representativeness, and measurement issues."
853,Nomogram predicting risk of lymphocele in gynecologic cancer patients undergoing pelvic lymph node dissection,유바램 /Baraem Yoo,2017,대한산부인과학회,"Objective: The purpose of this study is to estimate the risk of postoperative lymphocele development after lymphadenectomy in gynecologic cancer patients through establishing a nomogram.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 371 consecutive gynecologic cancer patients undergoing lymphadenectomy between 2009 and 2014. Association of the development of postoperative lymphocele with clinical characteristics was evaluated in univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Nomograms were built based on the data of multivariate analysis using R-software.
Results: Mean age at the operation was 50.8±11.1 years. Postoperative lymphocele was found in 70 (18.9%) patients. Of them, 22 (31.4%) had complicated one. Multivariate analysis revealed that hypertension (hazard ratio [HR], 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 6.0; P=0.003), open surgery (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.1; P=0.004), retrieved lymph nodes (LNs) >21 (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.3; P=0.042), and no use of intermittent pneumatic compression (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 7.2; P=0.047) were independent risk factors for the development of postoperative lymphocele. The nomogram appeared to be accurate and predicted the lymphocele development better than chance (concordance index, 0.754). For complicated lymphoceles, most variables which have shown significant association with general lymphocele lost the statistical significance, except hypertension (P=0.011) and mean number of retrieved LNs (29.5 vs. 21.1; P=0.001). A nomogram for complicated lymphocele showed similar predictive accuracy (concordance index, 0.727).
Conclusion: We developed a nomogram to predict the risk of lymphocele in gynecologic cancer patients on the basis of readily obtained clinical variables. External validation of this nomogram in different group of patients is needed."

However, the effects of LA on the level of myokines remain largely unknown. Aims of this study were to evaluate whether LA regulates the expression of myokines in C2C12 myotubes and to explore the regulatory mechanisms.
METHODS: As a number of studies reported that intense exercise induced accumulation of 4-20 mM LA in blood, C2C12 myotubes were treated with LA of 0, 4 or 16 mM for 0.5, 1 or 4 hr. We measured mRNA and protein levels of myostatin (Mstn), and fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) using real-time PCR or western blot, respectively.
RESULTS: LA reduced the levels of both mRNA and protein of Mstn from 4 hr after treatment. The level of FNDC5 mRNA was increased by LA within 1 hr, which returned to the basal level at 4 hr. but not increased the expression of FNDC5 protein levels. The levels of phosphorylated 5-AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPKThr172) show an increasing trend but its target phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase at Ser79 (p-ACCser79) was increased by LA within 30 min.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated the regulatory effect of LA on myokine expression, indicating that LA may be a metabolic factor contributing to secretory functions of skeletal muscle during high intensity physical exercise. In addition, LA accumulation at early time of physical exercise may influence on the signaling of intracellular energy metabolism, although further studies are needed to confirm our hypotheses.Lactic acid, Myostatin, Irisin, AMPK, Myokine"
856,Nutritional status in the era of target therapy: poor nutrition is a prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer with activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutations,박세훈 /Sehhoon Park,2016,대한내과학회,"Background/Aims: Pretreatment nutritional status is an important prognostic factor in patients treated with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. In the era of target therapies, its value is overlooked and has not been investigated. The aim of our study is to evaluate the value of nutritional status in targeted therapy.
Methods: A total of 2012 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were reviewed and 630 patients with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) were enrolled for the final analysis. Anemia, body mass index (BMI), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were considered as nutritional factors. Hazard ratio (HR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for each group were calculated by Cox proportional analysis. In addition, scores were applied for each category and the sum of scores was used for survival analysis.
Results: In univariable analysis, anemia (HR, 1.29; p = 0.015), BMI lower than 18.5 (HR, 1.98; p = 0.002), and PNI lower than 45 (HR, 1.57; p < 0.001) were poor prognostic factors for PFS. Among them, BMI and PNI were independent in multi-variable analysis. All of these were also significant prognostic values for OS. The higher the sum of scores, the poorer PFS and OS were observed.
Conclusions: Pretreatment nutritional status is a prognostic marker in NSCLC patients treated with EGFR TKI. Hence, baseline nutritional status should be more carefully evaluated and adequate nutrition should be supplied to these patients."
857,Prototypes of Panaxadiol and Panaxatriol Saponins Suppress LPS-mediated iNOS/NO Production in RAW264.7 Murine Macrophage Cells,문자영 /Ja-Young Moon,2016,한국생명과학회,"This study was performed to investigate the modulatory effects of two prototypes of Panax ginseng saponin fractions, 20(S)-protopanaxadiol saponins (PDS) and 20(S)-protopanaxatriol saponins (PTS), on the induction of inflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells. For this purpose, RAW264.7 cells were treated with LPS (10 μg/ml) before, after, or simultaneously with PDS or PTS (150 μg/ml), and the released level of nitric oxide (NO) and expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were evaluated. When RAW264.7 cells were treated with LPS and ginseng saponin fractions simultaneously for 24 hr, PTS, compared to PDS, more strongly attenuated the NO production induced by LPS treatment. When the cells were pretreated with LPS for 2 hr followed by PDS or PTS treatment for 24 hr, both ginseng saponins strongly reduced NO release. The pretreatment of RAW264.7 cells with PDS or PTS for 2 hr followed by LPS treatment for 24 hr significantly attenuated the LPS-induced production of NO. PTS showed stronger inhibitory potency to NO generation than PDS. Our western blot experiment showed that both PDS and PTS (150 μg/ml) also significantly down-regulated the expressions of iNOS and COX-2 induced by LPS treatment. Our results suggest that both PDS and PTS possess strong protective effects against LPS-stimulated inflammation and that their protective effects are mediated by the suppression of NO synthesis via down-regulation of pro-inflammatory enzymes, iNOS, and COX-2 in the RAW264.7 cells.본 연구는 RAW264.7 세포에서 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 처리에 의한 염증매개인자의 유도에 대한 고려인삼 사포닌 분획인 20(S)-protopanaxadiol saponins (PDS)과 20(S)-protopanaxatriol saponins (PTS)의 조절효능을 탐구하였다. 이를 위해 RAW264.7 세포에 PDS 또는 PTS를 150 μg/ml의 농도로 LPS (10 μg/ml) 처리 이전이나 처리 이후 또는 LPS와 동시에 처리하였으며, 처리된 세포에서 nitric oxide (NO)의 방출량, 유도성 nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) 및 cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)의 발현 량을 분석하였다. PDS에 비하여 PTS는 RAW264.7 세포에 LPS와 동시에 처리하여 24시간 동안 배양했을 때 LPS 처리에 의해 유도된 NO의 생성을 강하게 감소시켰다. RAW 264.7 세포에 LPS (10 μg/ml)를 2시간 동안 처리한 후에 PDS 또는 PTS를 150 μg/ml 농도로 24시간 동안 처리하면 두 인삼 사포닌 성분 모두 NO의 생성을 강하게 감소시켰다. RAW264.7 세포에 PDS 또는 PTS를 150 μg/ml농도로 2시간 동안 처리한 후에 LPS (10 μg/ml)를 24시간 동안 처리했을 경우에도 두 인삼 사포닌 성분 모두 LPS 처리에 의해 유도된 NO 생성을 강하게 감소시켰다. LPS 처리에 의한 NO 생성을 저해하는 효과는 PDS에 비하여 PTS가 더 강하게 나타났다. PDS와 PTS 모두 150 μg/ml 처리농도에서 LPS (10 μg/ml)처리에 의해 유도된 iNOS와 COX-2의 발현 역시 상당히 감소시켰다. 따라서 본 연구의 결과는 RAW264.7 대식세포에서 PDS와 PTS 두 인삼 사포닌 성분은 LPS 처리에 의한 염증활성화에 강한 억제효과를 가지고 있음을 의미하며, 전염증성 효소인 iNOS와 COX-2 발현의 감소조절을 통하여 NO의 생성을 억제함으로써 항 염증효과가 나타남을 제시한다."

For high-salinity and low-salinity soils the ECes were ranged from 25.2 to 37.8 dS m-1 and 3.0 to 3.4 dS m-1 while the ESPs were ranged from 7.70 to 20.84 % and from 5.12 to 11.33 %, respectively. The bulk densities of the soil columns were adjusted to 1.15 ± 0.03 g cm-3. The results of the soil column experiments shows that the stabilized saturated hydraulic conductivity of low-salinity soil was 0.62 cm hr-1 at the topsoil while there were little water flow at the bottom of the soil columns packed with high-salinity soils. After
removal of Na+ ions with 1N NH4OAc from the high-salinity soil, Ksat of the saline soil was drastically increased to 0.23 cm hr-1. Soil columns of high-salinity topsoil treated with four different concentration of NaCl influent after removal of soluble and exchangeable cations with 1N NH4OAc show Ksat in the range of 0.1~0.15 cm hr-1 and the Ksat slightly decreased as the concentration of NaCl influent was increasing.
Conclusively, we could assume that Na+ can be significantly contributed to the saturated hydraulic conductivity in newly reclaimed sandy soil.In order to identify the effect of soil salinity on saturated hydraulic conductivity in reclaimed paddy soils, we established the soil columns uniformly packed with soils collected at every 20 cm up to 60 cm from the reclaimed paddy area with high and low salinity which has been cultivated rice plants for the last 30 years.

862,Establishment of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mouse model based on the elapsed time after LPS intranasal instillation,이순영 /Soon-Young Lee,2018,한국실험동물학회,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the 3rd leading cause of death in 2012 worldwide. It is particularly severe in the elderly, who are at risk of death by coughing, mucous hypersecretion, and finally breathlessness. Recently, anti-COPD drug development has increased, and many animal screening systems have been studied. Tobacco smoke animal models are the best known animal screening system, but have several preparation requirements, such as a tobacco smoke generator and a separate facility to prevent smoke release. Accordingly, we evaluated the properties of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) murine model for COPD screening and the effect of the time elapsed from 0 to 72 hr after LPS intranasal instillation on various biomarkers of COPD severity, such as WBC and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF), IgE in serum, histopathology in the lung, and cytokines (IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and TGF-β) and chemokines (CCL-2, CXCL1, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) in the respiratory system. Although from 48 hr after LPS treatment several factors which could be evaluated as biomarkers for COPD establishment such as WBC and neutrophil in BALF, IgE in serum, cytokines (IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-γ), and chemokines (CCL-2, CXCL1, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) increased at 72 hr the increment of important factors for COPD establishment such as IgE, fibrosis in the lung, and cytokines (IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) was more clear. Based on our results, we concluded that the optimal time after LPS intranasal instillation is 72 hr."

METHODS: Data from the 2006 baseline and 2016 follow-up assessments of the Korean longitudinal study of aging (KLoSA) involving 9,270 Korean adults aged ≥45 years (55.6% women) were used in the study. Study participants were classified as zero, one, and two or more categories based on number of co-morbidities and as high, middle, and low categories based on HGS distributions. The Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of all-cause mortality according to HGS categories and number of comorbidities.
RESULTS: During the 9.7±2.7 year follow-up period, 1,285 deaths from all causes occurred. In both middle and low HGS categories, one and two or more comorbidities resulted in an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR=1.493; 95% CI=1.220-1.828; p<.001 and HR=1.427; 95% CI=1.190-1.711; p<.001, respectively) compared to no comorbidity (HR=1). Furthermore, the increased risks of all-cause mortality remained significant even after adjustments for a number of confounders such as age, sex, socio-economic status, and parameters of health behaviors and conditions. In high HGS category, there were no significant differences in the risk of all-cause mortality according to number of co-morbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: The current finding suggested that promotion of upper body muscular strength may play an important role in preventing premature death from all causes, especially among those who suffer from co-morbidities.Co-morbidity, Hand grip strength, All-cause mortality, Middle-aged and older adults"

This study investigated the productivity and operational costs of tree-length cable yarding system using HAM300, a domestically developed tower yarder. We tested HAM300 for thinning operation in Pinus densiflora stands at Gangreung, Gangwon-do on April, 2014. To assess the productivity we conducted time study for each stage of the operation. When the average time/cycle was examined for each stage of the operation, the longest was for yarding (241 sec), followed by delimbing (237 sec), felling (153 sec), and processing (103 sec). Furthermore, productivity for felling was 8.6 m³/hr, followed by delimbing (5.1 m³/hr), yarding (3.5 m³/hr), and processing (8.1 m³/hr). The total cost for the tree-length logging system was 58,446 won/m³, of which the majority was incurred by the yarding cost at 46,217 won/m³ (79.3%), whereas the lowest cost was for felling at 2,359 won/m³ (4.1%). We suggest that it is necessary to foster specialized operators and provide training in operating the tower yarder thereby implementing efficient harvesting system resulting from low-cost yarding."

Methods: The prognostic impact of CLR was investigated in 636 CRC patients to compare methods from previously published articles. These methods included CLR measured by number of lymphoid aggregates (LAs) (CLR count), LA size greater than or equal to 1 mm (CLR size), CLR density with a cutoff value of 0.38, and subjective criteria as defined by intense CLR. Results: In univariate survival analysis, CLR-positive CRC as defined by the four aforementioned methods was associated with better overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.463; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.305 to 0.702; p < .001; HR, 0.656; 95% CI, 0.411 to 1.046; p = .077; HR, 0.363; 95% CI, 0.197 to 0.669; p = .001; and HR, 0.433; 95% CI, 0.271 to 0.690; p < .001, respectively) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 0.411; 95% CI, 0.304 to 0.639; p < .001; HR, 0.528; 95% CI, 0.340 to 0.821; p = .004; HR, 0.382; 95% CI, 0.226 to 0.645, p = .004; and HR, 0.501; 95% CI, 0.339 to 0.741; p < .001, respectively) than CLR-negative CRC, regardless of criteria with the exception of OS for CLR density. In multivariate analysis, two objective criteria (CLR count and CLR density) and one subjective criterion (intense CLR) for defining CLR were considered independent prognostic factors of OS and DFS in CRC patients. Conclusions: CLR has similar traits regardless of criteria, but CLR-positivity should be defined by objective criteria for better reproducibility and prognostic value."

871,Predicting Factors for Stent Failure-Free Survival in Patients With a Malignant Ureteral Obstruction Managed With Ureteral Stents,유성현,2013,대한비뇨의학회,"Purpose: To determine predictive factors for stent failure-free survival in patients treated with a retrograde ureteral stent for a malignant ureteral obstruction.
Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 71 patients who underwent insertion of a cystoscopic ureteral stent due to a malignant ureteral obstruction between May 2004 and June 2011. Performance status, type of cancer, hydronephrosis grade,location of the obstruction, presence of bladder invasion, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum albumin, and inflammation-based prognostic score (Glasgow prognostic score,GPS) were assessed using a Cox proportional regression hazard model as predicting factors for stent failure.
Results: A univariate analysis indicted that hypoalbuminemia (＜3.5 g/dL; hazard ratio [HR], 2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21 to 4.86; p=0.012), elevated CRP (≥1mg/dL; HR, 4.79; 95% CI, 2.0 to 11.1; p=0.001), and presence of a distal ureter obstruction (HR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.19 to 8.95; p=0.021) were associated with stent failure-free survival. A multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of a mid and lower ureteral obstruction (HR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.19 to 8.95; p=0.007), GPS ≥1 (HR, 7.22; 95%CI, 2.89 to 18.0; p=0.001), and elevated serum creatinine before ureteral stent placement (＞1.2 mg/dL; HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.02 to 4.57; p=0.044) were associated with stent failure-free survival.
Conclusions: A mid or lower ureteral obstruction, GPS ≥1, and serum creatinine before ureteral stent insertion ＞1.2 mg/dL were unfavorable predictors of stent failure-free survival. These factors may help urologists predict survival time."

Before anesthesia induction, all patients received normal saline (control) or one of the following 3 doses of remifentanil: 1.0 μg/kg of remifentanil (remifentanil 1.0), 1.5 μg/kg of remifentanil (remifentanil 1.5), and 2.0 μg/kg of remifentanil (remifentanil 2.0). After induction with propofol and rocuronium, 1.3 minimal alveolar concentration of desflurane with oxygen was administered via a face mask. Heart rate (HR) and mean blood pressure (MBP) were recorded before remifentanil administration, and 1, 2, and 3 min after inhalation of desflurane, as well as 0, 1, 2, and 3 min after intubation. The proportions of patients with hemodynamics that maintained within ± 25% of preinduction values (MBP and HR proportion) were calculated.
Results: MBP and HR were lower in the 3 remifentanil groups than in the control group throughout the study period. The MBP proportion was higher in remifentanil 1.0 group than in control group. The HR proportion was higher in the 3 remifentanil groups than in control group.
Conclusions: A single bolus injection of remifentanil (1.0–2.0 μg/kg) may be effective in alleviating adverse hemodynamic changes induced by both desflurane inhalation and tracheal intubation. Especially, administration of remifentanil 1.0 μg/kg maintained more stable blood pressure compared to the control group throughout the study period."

In an effort to balance the risks and benefits of therapy, risk-stratified therapy has been adopted. The aim of this study was to evaluate treatment outcome of childhood ALL by risk stratification.
Methods: From 184 patients (age, ＜18 years) with ALL newly diagnosed at Chonnam National University Hospital and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital between 2000 and 2010, we retrospectively analyzed 157 patients. Patients with infant ALL, L3, Down syndrome, and those transferred to another hospital were excluded. Three risk groups were defined as standard risk (SR, n=88), high risk (HR, n=52) and very high risk (VHR, n=17).
Results: The 7-year overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 85.2±2.9% and 80.2±3.3%, respectively. The 7-year EFS rates were 86.5±3.9% for SR, 78.8±5.7% for HR and 52.9±12.1% for VHR (P＜0.001). Relapse occurred in 17 patients, and the cumulative incidence of relapse at 7 years was not different according to risk groups (SR vs. HR vs. VHR=8.9% vs. 17.3% vs. 5.9%, P=0.171). Among relapsed patients, 11 underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of whom 5 survive event-free with a median follow-up of 5.2 years. The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was highest in VHR (SR vs. HR vs. VHR=4.6% vs. 3.8% vs. 47.2%, P＜0.001).
Conclusion: Although, the number of patients included in this study is relatively small, the survival rates of childhood ALL with current strategies are encouraging. Also, efforts should be focused to further improve survival in the VHR, especially to reduce non-relapse mortality."
874,Effect of rainfall events on soil carbon flux in mountain pastures,정석희,2017,한국생태학회,"Background: Large-scale land-use change is being caused by various socioeconomic problems. Land-use change is necessarily accompanied by changes in the regional carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems and affects climate change. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the correlation between environmental factors altered by land-use change and the carbon balance. To address this issue, we studied the characteristics of soil carbon flux and soil moisture content related to rainfall events in mountain pastures converted from deciduous forest in Korea.
Results: The average soil moisture contents (SMC) during the study period were 23.1% in the soil respiration (SR) plot and 25.2% in the heterotrophic respiration (HR) plot. The average SMC was increased to 2.1 and 1.1% in the SR and HR plots after rainfall events, respectively. In addition, saturated water content was 29.36% in this grassland. The soil water content was saturated under the consistent rainfall of more than 5 mm h−1 rather than short-term heavy rainfall event. The average SR was increased to 28.4% after a rainfall event, but the average HR was decreased to 70.
1%. The correlation between soil carbon flux rates and rainfall was lower than other environmental factors. The correlation between SMC and soil carbon flux rates was low. However, HR exhibited a tendency to be decreased when SMC was 24.5%. In addition, the correlation between soil temperature and respiration rate was significant.
Conclusions: In a mountain pasture ecosystem, rainfall induced the important change of soil moisture content related to respiration in soil. SR and HR were very sensitive to change of SMC in soil surface layer about 0–10-cm depth. SR was increased by elevation of SMC due to a rainfall event, and the result was assumed from maintaining moderate soil moisture content for respiration in microorganism and plant root. However, HR was decreased in long-time saturated condition of soil moisture content. Root has obviously contributed to high respiration in heavy rainfall, but it was affected to quick depression in respiration under low rainfall. The difference of SMC due to rainfall event was causative of a highly fluctuated soil respiration rate in the same soil temperature condition.
Therefore, rainfall factor or SMC are to be considered in predicting the soil carbon flux of grassland ecosystems for future climate change."
875,Association of serum mineral parameters with mortality in hemodialysis patients: Data from the Korean endstage renal disease registry,김윤미 /Yunmi Kim,2018,대한신장학회,"Background: We investigated the associations between mineral metabolism parameters and mortality to identify optimal targets in Korean hemodialysis patients.
Methods: Among hemodialysis patients registered in the end-stage renal disease registry of the Korean Society of Nephrology between March 2012 and June 2017, those with serum calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) measured at enrollment were included. Association of serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and iPTH with all-cause mortality was analyzed.
Results: Among 21,433 enrolled patients, 3,135 (14.6%) died during 24.8 ± 14.5 months of follow-up. After multivariable adjustment, patients in the first quintile of corrected calcium were associated with lower mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.71-0.99; P = 0.003), while those in the fifth quintile were associated with higher mortality (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.20-1.61; P < 0.001) compared with those in the third quintile. For phosphorus, only the lowest quintile was significantly associated with increased mortality (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43; P = 0.003). The lowest (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.36; P = 0.026) and highest quintiles of iPTH (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.46; P = 0.013) were associated with increased mortality. For target counts achieved according to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guideline, patients who did not achieve any mineral parameter targets hadhigher mortality than those who achieved all three targets (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.12-1.67; P = 0.003).
Conclusion: In Korean hemodialysis patients, high serum calcium, low phosphorus, and high and low iPTH levels were associated with increased all-cause mortality."
876,Observational Arc-Length Effect on Orbit Determination for KPLO Using a Sequential Estimation Technique,김영록 /Young-Rok Kim,2018,한국우주과학회,"In this study, orbit determination (OD) simulation for the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO) was accomplished for investigation of the observational arc-length effect using a sequential estimation algorithm. A lunar polar orbit located at 100 km altitude and 90° inclination was mainly considered for the KPLO mission operation phase. For measurement simulation and OD for KPLO, the Analytical Graphics Inc. Systems Tool Kit 11 and Orbit Determination Tool Kit 6 software were utilized.
Three deep-space ground stations, including two deep space network (DSN) antennas and the Korea Deep Space Antenna, were configured for the OD simulation. To investigate the arc-length effect on OD, 60-hr, 48-hr, 24-hr, and 12-hr tracking data were prepared. Position uncertainty by error covariance and orbit overlap precision were used for OD performance evaluation.
Additionally, orbit prediction (OP) accuracy was also assessed by the position difference between the estimated and true orbits. Finally, we concluded that the 48-hr-based OD strategy is suitable for effective flight dynamics operation of KPLO. This work suggests a useful guideline for the OD strategy of KPLO mission planning and operation during the nominal lunar orbits phase."
877,Survival implication of lymphadenectomy in patients surgically treated for apparent early-stage uterine serous carcinoma,Jvan Casarin,2020,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is a rare highly aggressive disease. In the presentstudy, we aimed to investigate the survival implication of the systematic lymphadenectomy inpatients who underwent surgery for apparent early-stage USC.
Methods: Consecutive patients with apparent early-stage USC surgically treated at sixItalian referral cancer centers were analyzed. A comparison was made between patients whounderwent retroperitoneal staging including at least pelvic lymphadenectomy “LND” vs.
those who underwent hysterectomy alone “NO-LND”. Baseline, surgical and oncologicaloutcomes were analyzed. Kaplan- Meier curves were calculated for disease-free survival(DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Associations were evaluated with Cox proportionalhazard regression and summarized using hazard ratio (HR).
Results: One hundred forty patients were analyzed, 106 LND and 34 NO-LND. NO-LNDgroup (compared to LND group) included older patients (median age, 73 vs.67 years) andwith higher comorbidities (median Charlson Comorbidity Index, 6 vs. 5) (p<0.001). Nodifferences in terms of recurrence rate (LND vs. NO-LND, 33.1% vs. 41.4%; p=0.240) wereobserved. At Cox regression analysis lymphadenectomy did not significantly influenceDFS (HR=0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.32–1.08; p=0.09), and DSS (HR=0.14; 95%CI=0.02–1.21; multivariable analysis p=0.07). Positive node was independently associatedwith worse DFS (HR=6.22; 95% CI=3.08–12.60; p<0.001) and DSS (HR=5.51; 95% CI=2.31–13.10; p<0.001), while adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved DFS (HR=0.38;95% CI=0.17–0.86; p=0.02) and age was independently associated with worse DSS (HR=1.07;95% CI=1.02–1.13; p<0.001).
Conclusions: Although lymphadenectomy did not show survival benefits in patients whounderwent surgery for apparent early-stage USC, the presence of lymph node metastasis was the main adverse prognostic factors, supporting the prognostic role of the retroperitonealstaging also in this histological subtype."

In this study, we analyzed the nucleotide sequence of the Anguilla japonica CYP1(AjCYP1) family gene and examined the relative expression of AjCYP1A, AjCYP1B and AjCYP1C1 in response to the exposure to environmental pollutants. After exposure to B[a]P 20mg/kg bw, the expression of AjCYP1 family gene increased over time. Among four tissues examined (liver, spleen, gill and kidney), AjCYP1 family gene was expressed significantly in the kidney. Compared with the control group, AjCYP1A was expressed about 5-fold at 48 hr, AjCYP1B about 6-fold at 24 hr, and AjCYP1C1 about 4-fold at 24 hr. However, after exposure to B[a]P 200mg/kg bw, AjCYP1A did not change in all tissues. On the other hand, AjCYP1B was expressed at about 4-fold at 24 hr in the spleen and 4-fold at 48 hr in the gill. Finally AjCYP1C1 was expressed 3.7-fold and 4.3-fold in the spleen and kidneys at 48 hr, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest that the expression of AjCYP1 gene in eel tissues might be used as a useful tool to assess the exposure to environmental pollutants in aquaculture system"

Methods: Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort data from 2002 to 2013 were used. A total of 50,954patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes from 2004 to 2012 and aged 30 years or above were included. We classified patientsinto six groups according to individual income level and neighborhood deprivation: ‘high in advantaged,’ ‘high in disadvantaged,’‘middle in advantaged,’ ‘middle in disadvantaged,’ ‘low in advantaged,’ and ‘low in disadvantaged.’ We calculated hazard ratios (HR)of onset of diabetes complication and diabetes-related hospitalization using the Cox proportional hazard model, with the referencegroup as diabetes patients with high income in advantaged regions.
Results: In terms of the interaction effects of individual income level and regional socioeconomic level, even with the same lowindividual income level, the group with a high regional socioeconomic level (low in advantaged) showed low HRs for the onset ofdiabetes complication (HR, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00–1.08) compared to the ‘low in disadvantaged’ group (HR, 1.10;95% CI, 1.05–1.16). In addition, the ‘high in advantaged’ group showed slightly higher HRs for the onset of diabetes complication (HR,1.06; 95% CI, 1.00–1.11) compared to the ‘low in advantaged’ and it appeared to be associated with slight mitigation of the risk ofdiabetes complication. For the low-income level, the patients in disadvantaged regions showed the highest HRs for diabetes-relatedhospitalization (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.19–1.41) compared to the other groups.
Conclusion: Although we need to perform further investigations to reveal the mechanisms that led to our results, interaction effectsindividual socioeconomic status and regional deprivation might be associated with on onset of diabetes complications anddiabetes-related hospitalization among type 2 diabetes patients."

In this study, two athletes with differing levels of perceived stress, wereexposed to psychological stress performance tasks and green therapy treatment once a day for 30 minutesover the course of four days. As the independent variable(IV), subjects performed computerized versions oftwo psychological stressor tasks; reading color words and rapid mental arithmetic. Green Therapy consisted ofexposure to natural sounds of a forest, the inhalation of natural phytoncide aroma, and the application ofpeppermint and rosemary extract aroma oil. As the dependent variable(DV), physiological changes associatedwith stress including heart rate (HR) and electromyogram(EMG) were measured. The mixed design withA-B-A-B and multiple baseline was designed to verify the relationships between IV and DV. Results of day 1,non-treatment phase, showed that both athletes had elevated HR and EMG at rest and after performance ofthe psychological stress tasks. The same psychological stress performance tasks were carried out the secondday in the Green Therapy room, however, HR and EMG were significantly lower at rest. Furthermore, therecovery rate after performing the stress tasks was significantly faster compared to the first day. On thethird day (non-treatment phase reversal step), athletes were removed from the Green Therapy room andperformed the same stress performance tasks. HR and EMG were elevated compared to forest therapy. Onthe second re-treatment phase of the fourth day, athletes conducted stress performance tasks once again inthe Green Therapy room. Compared to the non-treatment phase, BVP and EMG scores were once againlower. In conclusion, forest therapy relieves psychological stress of athletes and promotes recovery from stressat rest. However, the effect is temporary. Nevertheless, the temporary effects of Green Therapy are shownto repeatedly appear when treatment is given.Green Therapy, Stress, Stress Management, Single-Subject Design"

885,The prophylactic effects of gabapentin on postoperative sore throat after thyroid surgery,이재호 /Jae Ho Lee,2013,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: Postoperative sore throat (POST) is considered a usual complication after tracheal intubation, especially, thyroid surgery. Gabapentin is a widely studied multimodal perioperative drug, which can be used to treat acute postoperative pain. The primary endpoints of this study was a reduction of the incidence of POST at rest and during the swallowing movements after thyroid surgery. And the second endpoints was a reduction of the intensity of the POST after thyroid surgery.
Methods: Seventy-one patients that underwent elective thyroid surgery received either gabapentin (NeurontinTM 600 mg) or placebo, orally, one hour before anesthesia. The VAS scores and incidences of POST and adverse effects were determined at 1 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, and 24 hr after surgery at rest and during swallowing movement.
Results: The gabapentin group (N = 36) showed a lower incidence of POST than the placebo group (N = 35) (47% vs. 78%, P = 0.038), and had significant lower VAS score at 6 and 24 hours after surgery in the resting state. However, during the movement, no intergroup differences were found in terms of the incidence of POST (83% vs. 91%, P = 0.305) or VAS score. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed between the two groups, in adverse effects.
Conclusions: Gabapentin (NeurontinTM 600 mg) administered 1 hr before anesthesia reduced the intensity and incidence of POST during the resting state without a significant adverse event, during the 24 hr after thyroid surgery. However, gabapentin did not reduce the intensity and incidence of POST during the swallowing movement."

We examined the expression of AEG-1 in patients with hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC).
Methods: Eighty-five samples were collected from patients with HCC who underwent surgery and were histopathologicallyconfirmed to have HCC. Two independent pathologists, experienced in evaluating immunohistochemistry and blindedto the clinical outcomes of the patients, reviewed all samples. They determined AEG-1 expression semiquantitatively byassessing the percentage of positively stained immunoreactive cells and staining intensity. Clinicopathological data wereanalyzed in association with prognosis.
Results: The association was estimated by univariate and multivariate analyses with Cox regression. Tumor size (hazardratio [HR], 2.285; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.175–4.447; P = 0.015), microvascular invasion (HR, 6.754; 95% CI, 1.631–27.965; P = 0.008), and AEG-1 expression (HR, 4.756; 95% CI, 1.697–13.329; P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factorsfor overall survival. Those for disease-free survival rate were tumor size (HR, 2.245; 95% CI, 1.282–3.933; P = 0.005) andAEG-1 expression (HR, 1.916; 95% CI, 1.035–3.545; P = 0.038). The cumulative 5-year survival and recurrence rates were89.2% and 50.0% in the low-expressing group and 24.5% and 82.4% in the high-expressing group, respectively.
Conclusion: The results suggest that AEG-1 overexpression could serve as a valuable prognostic marker in patients withHCC."
887,Impact of Resection Margin Distance on Survival of Pancreatic Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,김경수 /Kyung Su Kim,2017,대한암학회,"Purpose While curative resection is the only chance of cure in pancreatic cancer, controversies exist about the impact of surgical margin status on survival. Non-standardized pathologic report and different criteria on the R1 status made it difficult to implicate adjuvant therapy after resection based on the margin status. We evaluated the influence of resection margins on survival by meta-analysis.
Materials and Methods We thoroughly searched electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library.
We included studies reporting survival outcomes with different margin status: involved margin (R0 mm), margin clearance with # 1 mm (R0-1 mm), and margin with > 1 mm (R>1 mm).
Hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was extracted, and a random-effects model was used for pooled analysis.
Results A total of eight retrospective studies involving 1,932 patients were included. Pooled HR for overall survival showed that patients with R>1 mm had reduced risk of death than those with R0-1 mm (HR, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 0.88; p=0.001). In addition, patients with R0-1 mm had reduced risk of death than those with R0 mm (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.91; p < 0.001). There was no heterogeneity between the included studies (I2 index, 42% and 0%; p=0.10 and p=0.82, respectively).
Conclusion Our results suggest that stratification of the patients based on margin status is warranted in the clinical trials assessing the role of adjuvant treatment for pancreatic cancer."

Methods: We calculated the risk of specific death by SBP and DBP categories for 506 508 health examinees in 2002-2003 using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in a Cox proportional hazards model.
Results: Compared to normal levels (SBP <120 or DBP <90 mmHg), stage I systolic and diastolic hypertension (SBP 140-159, DBP 85-89 mmHg, respectively) were associated with an increased risk of death from diabetes mellitus, alcoholic liver disease, and renal failure (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.51 to 2.22; HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.46; HR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.64 to 3.21; HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.20; HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.81; HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.73, respectively), but a decreased risk of death from intestinal pneumonia (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.98; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.91). Only stage II systolic hypertension (SBP ≥160 mmHg) was associated with an increased risk of death from pneumonia, liver cirrhosis, and intestinal ischemia (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.98; HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.15; HR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.24 to 11.40, respectively), and stage I and II diastolic hypertension (SBP 140-159 and ≥160 mmHg) were associated with an increased risk of death from intestinal ischemia (HR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.27 to 7.38; HR, 4.39; 95% CI, 1.62 to 11.88, respectively).
Conclusions: An increase in blood pressure levels may alter the risk of death from certain causes other than cardiovascular diseases, a well-known outcome of hypertension, although the mechanism of these associations is not well documented."

In this study, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 2 (ECI2) gene in Berkshire pigs (n = 430) by analyzed the association between the SNP and meat quality traits. The non-synonymous SNP in the ECI2 gene is located at c.608 C > G and resulted in an amino acid change from threonine to serine. Significant associations between the SNP and meat quality traits, such as redness (CIE a), and the pH24hr, were revealed in both the dominant and co-dominant models, whereas carcass weight, drip loss, and fat content and moisture content were significantly associated only with the dominant model. In barrow, the SNP was significantly associated with CIE a, drip loss, and pH24hr, whereas in gilt, only a significant relationship with moisture content was observed. GG genotype pigs had a higher pH24hr and lower drip loss. Because pH24hr and drip loss are considered the most important meat quality traits, GG genotype pork is high-quality meat compared to that from other genotypes. In conclusion, the SNP in the ECI2 gene is significantly associated with several meat quality traits. These traits and could be as genetic markers in molecular breeding programs for improving meat quality."

896,Effectiveness of Gastric Cancer Screening on Gastric Cancer Incidence and Mortality in a Community-Based Prospective Cohort,김희원 /Heewon Kim,2018,대한암학회,"Purpose This study was performed to investigate the effectiveness of gastric cancer (GC) screening methods in a community-based prospective cohort of the Korean Multi-center Cancer Cohort (KMCC) with over a 10-year follow-up.
Materials and Methods A total 10,909 and 4,773 subjects from the KMCC with information on gastroendoscopy (GE) and upper gastrointestinal series (UGIS) were included in this study. Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, Helicobacter pylori infection, cigarette smoking, and alcohol drinking was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results The GE screened subjects had almost half the risk of GC-specific death than that of unscreened subjects (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.94). Among the GC patients, GE screenees had a 2.24-fold higher survival rate than that of the non-screenees (95% CI, 1.61 to 3.11). In particular, GE screenees who underwent two or more screening episodes had a higher survival rate than that of the non-screenees (HR, 13.11; 95% CI, 7.38 to 23.30). The effectiveness of GE screening on reduced GC mortality and increased survival rate of GC patients was better in elderly subjects ( 65 years old) (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.95 and HR, 8.84; 95% CI, 3.63 to 21.57, respectively) than that in younger subjects (< 65 years old) (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.29 and HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.68, respectively). In contrast, UGIS screening had no significant relation to GC mortality and survival.

NO2−-N+NO3−-N 농도 실험에서 20oC의 경우 염소를 투입하여 질산화균을 사멸한 후 활성화된 질산화균을 투입하면, 정상수준까지 회복하는 데약 4일 정도 소요되었다. 10oC의 경우, 활성화된 질산화균을 투입하여 이전 상태로 회복 되는 데는 약 7일 정도 소요되어 20oC에 비하여 약 3일이 더 소요되었다. 비질산화속도 실험에서는 10oC 운전조건에서 활성화된 질산화균 투입 후 1일경과시 비질산화속도는 0029 mgN/gSS/hr에서 6일 경과시 0.767 mgN/gSS/hr까지 증가하였다. 선형 모형식과 지수함수 모형식에 의한8일 경과후의 비질산화속도는 각각 0.840, 3.625 mgN/gSS/hr로 예측되어 정상수준인 2.592 mgN/gSS/hr을 상회하는 것으로예상되었다. 본 연구를 통하여 저온 운전시 활성화된 질산화균을 주입하면 질산화효율을 향상시키는데 많은 효과가 있음을확인하였다. 향후 연구에서 현장별 운전특성을 고려한 ANB 투입량의 결정, 효율적인 ANB reactor의 설계 등에 대한 추가적인 연구가 진행된다면 동절기 질산화효율 향상에 많은 기여를 할 수 있을 것이다.In this study, we have developed a lab scale bioreactor to identify the characteristics of nitrification reaction according to operation condition (temperature, inhibitor (as Cl), activated nitrifying bacteria (ANB). etc) to improve nitrification efficiency at low temperature. Recovery rate of nitrification took about 4 days to reach the normal level by injected ANB after inhibition shock of CI injection at 20oC, when measured the concentration of NO2−-N+NO3−-N in the effluent. In the case of 10oC, recovery of nitrification rate took about 4 days to reach the level of half to the normal level and 7 days for complete recovery which took 3 days more than those at 20oC. At 10oC considering the winter season, the specific nitrification rate(SNR) of the from 1 day to 6 days after injected ANB according to its operation condition increased from 0.029 to 0.767 mgN/gSS/hr. The simulated SNR for the 8th day after the injected ANB at 10oC was 0.840, 3.625 mgN/gSS/hr, respectively as linear function and exponential function, expecting to exceed level of 2.592 mgN/gSS/hr at normal condition. It was confirmed that injection of ANB during low temperature operation has many effects for improving nitrification efficiency through this study. In future studies, if further studies are carried out the determination of ANB injection and the design of efficient ANB reactor considering the changes of operating characteristics by site, it will contribute to the improvement of nitrification efficiency in winter season.Nitrification, Activated nitrifying bacteria (ANB), Nitrification rate, Specific nitrification rate (SNR), Winter season, Inhibitor (as Cl)"
898,The frequency of POLE-mutation in endometrial carcinoma and prognostic implications: a systemic review and meta-analysis,Alaa Salah Jumaah,2020,대한병리학회,"Background: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is classified into four distinct molecular subgroups including ultramutated DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE). POLE-mutated tumors have the best prognosis and are a promising target for immunotherapy. This meta-analysis consolidated the reported variation of POLE-mutant frequency and assessed prognostic value in EC. Methods: Internet searches explored scientific data bases: EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. Data was extracted from eligible studies including: sample size, number of positive POLE-mutant cases, sequencing information, clinicopathologic data, and survival data. Meta-analysis and a random-effects model produced pooled estimates of POLE frequency and prognostic parameters using 95% confidence intervals (CI), hazard ratios (HR), and odd ratios (OR). Results: Six thousand three hundred and forty-six EC patient cases were pooled from 25 studies. The pooled proportion of POLE gene mutation in EC was 8.59% (95% CI, 7.01 to 10.32), of which 8.22% (95% CI, 6.27 to 10.42) were type I and 0.93% (95% CI, 0.34 to 1.81) type 2. Clinicopathologic data showed that POLE-mutated tumors are mostly endometrioid. They present at higher levels in earlier stages (I–II) of EC (89.51%; 95% CI, 81.11 to 95.66) at the highest grade III (51.53%; 95% CI, 36.08 to 66.84) with reduced myometrial invasion (OR, 1.48, 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.20). Survival analysis indicated favorable overall survival (HR, 0.90), disease-specific survival (HR, 0.41), and progression-free survival (HR, 0.23) for POLE mutant EC. Conclusions: Almost one-tenth of EC patients have POLE-mutated tumors. Given their improved prognostic potential, identifying the POLE mutation status is key for the management of EC patients."
899,Association between new-onset liver cirrhosis and suicide risk in South Korea: A nationwide cohort study,Suk-Yong Jang,2021,대한간학회,"Background/Aims: Current evidence suggests that liver cirrhosis (LC) causes severe psychological stress and depression, which are risk factors for suicide. Although previous studies reported the association between LC and suicidal thoughts, little is known of its effect on suicidal deaths. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of new-onset LC on suicide.
Methods: From the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort of South Korea, 5,809 incident LC patients and 11,618 risk-set controls matched by propensity score were selected for follow-up. The incidence rate of suicide was estimated using a generalized estimating equation with a Poisson distribution. Effect size was presented as a hazard ratio (HR) using Cox’s proportional hazards model.
Results: The incidence rate of suicide was 143.3 cases per 100,000 person years (95% confidence interval [CI], 100.2– 205.1) among the LC cohort. The LC patients were 2.37 times more likely to commit suicide compared with matched controls (HR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.44–3.88). Increased suicide risk was evident within the first 2 years of the follow-up period (HR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.20–5.60) and among the 18–49-year-old age group (HR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.45–9.56).
Conclusions: Our study found increased risk of suicide in patients with new onset LC, especially during the early period following diagnosis and in younger patients. To decrease this suicide risk, a regular and continuous social support system is required."
900,Effects of Red Ginseng Intake on Muscle Injury Due to Eccentric Exercise,Hyun Lyung Jung,2010,한국식품영양과학회,"This study examined the effects of Korean red ginseng (RG) on muscle injury induced by eccentric exercise. Eighteen college male students were randomly assigned to either the RG group or the placebo group (P). The RG group ingested RG extract at 20 g/day (mixed with 200 mL of water) for 7 days prior to performing a downhill treadmill exercise and for 3 days after performing the downhill treadmill exercise, while the P group ingested 200 mL of water containing Agastachis Herba for 7 days prior to and 3 days following a downhill treadmill exercise. All subjects performed 2 bouts of a downhill treadmill exercise (6 km, -14 degree slope, 12 km/hr speed) with a 5 minute resting interval between bouts. Blood samples were drawn immediately before and after exercise, and at 1 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, and 72 hr. Two-way repeated ANOVA documented that creatine kinase (CK) levels in the RG group were significantly reduced at 48 hr after exercise, as compared with P group, and remained constant until 72 hr after exercise. Lactate levels in the RG group were also significantly lower at 24 hr and 72 hr after exercise as compared to the P group. We conclude that supplementation of RGreduces CK levels and may prevent muscle injury induced by eccentric exercise."

대상과 방법: 동종 조혈모세포이식을 받고 안과에 방문한 환자 99명의 의무기록을 후향적으로 분석하였다. 세극등현미경 검사로 안구GVHD의 발생 여부를 살펴보고, 그에 따른 각 군의 임상적 특징과 생존율을 비교하였다. 그리고 안구 GVHD의 발생과 관련 있는위험인자에 대하여 분석하였다.
결과: 99명 중 38명(38.38%)에서 동종 조혈모세포이식술 후 평균 315일 후에 안구 GVHD가 발생하였다. 안구 GVHD로 진단된 38명중 22명(57.88%)은 건성안만을 보였고, 16명(42.11%)은 결막질환이 동반되었다. 위험인자 분석에서 타장기 GVHD의 발생 여부(hazard ratio (HR) 35.76, p<0.001)와, 침범 개수(HR 3.07, p<0.001)에 따라, 특히 피부(HR 2.31, p=0.029), 구강(HR 8.16, p<0.001),소화기(HR 5.00, p=0.002)를 침범한 경우 안구 GVHD의 발생률이 높았다. 경과관찰 기간 중 결막질환이 있는 군이 안구 GVHD가없는 군 및 건성안 군과 비교하여 생존율이 낮았으나 통계적으로 유의하지는 않았다(log rank test, p=0.208).
결론: 동종 조혈모세포이식 후 안구 GVHD는 빈번히 발생하고 상당수가 만성기에 발생하였다. 또한 타장기 GVHD의 발생과 그 개수,특히 피부, 구강, 소화기의 침범은 안구 GVHD의 발생에 영향을 미칠 수 있을 것으로 생각한다.Purpose: To investigate the incidence, clinical manifestations, and risk factors of ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) aswell as the survival of the patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Methods: The medical records of 99 patients who visited our clinic and were screened for ocular GVHD after allogeneic HSCTwere reviewed retrospectively. Subjects were divided into 2 groups depending on the occurrence of ocular GVHD on slit-lampbiomicroscopy. We compared clinical manifestations and survival between the 2 groups and analyzed the risk factors associatedwith the development of ocular GVHD.
Results: Ocular GVHD was diagnosed in 38 patients (38.38%) at a mean of 315 days after HSCT. Out of the 38 patients who developedocular GVHD, 22 patients (57.89%) were diagnosed with dry eye only and 16 patients (42.11%) were diagnosed withconjunctival disease. The presence of extraocular GVHD (hazard ratio (HR) 35.76, p < 0.001), the number of extraocular GVHD(HR 3.07, p < 0.001), skin GVHD (HR 2.31, p = 0.029), oral GVHD (HR 8.16, p < 0.001), and gastrointestinal tract GVHD (HR5.00, p = 0.002) were independent risk factors of ocular GVHD. Comparisons of the survival demonstrated decreased survival ofpatients with conjunctival disease compared to patients without ocular GVHD and patients with dry eye only, but there was nostatistically significant differences (log rank test, p = 0.208).
Conclusions: Ocular GVHD is common after allogeneic HSCT. The majority of ocular GVHD occurs in the chronic stage and isassociated with decreased survival. Therefore, more intensive and long-term follow-up with ophthalmic and systemic monitoringis necessary, especially in patients who have extraocular GVHD, for early recognition and proper treatment of ocular GVHD."
902,Greater Lymph Node Retrieval Improves Survival in Node-Negative Resected Gastric Cancer in the United States,Katelin A. Mirkin,2017,대한위암학회,"Purpose: Guidelines in Western countries recommend retrieving ≥15 lymph nodes (LNs) during gastric cancer resection. This study sought to determine whether the number of examined lymph nodes (eLNs), a proxy for lymphadenectomy, effects survival in node-negative disease.
Materials and Methods: The US National Cancer Database (2003–2011) was reviewed for node-negative gastric adenocarcinoma. Treatment was categorized by neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) vs. initial resection, and further stratified by eLN. Kaplan-Meier and Weibull models were used to analyze overall survival.
Results: Of the 1,036 patients who received NAT, 40.5% had ≤10 eLN, and most underwent proximal gastrectomy (67.8%). In multivariate analysis, greater eLN was associated with improved survival (eLN 16–20: HR, 0.71; P=0.039, eLN 21–30: HR, 0.55; P=0.001). Of the 2,795 patients who underwent initial surgery, 42.5% had ≤10 eLN, and the majority underwent proximal gastrectomy (57.2%). In multivariate analysis, greater eLN was associated with improved survival (eLN 11–15: HR, 0.81; P=0.021, eLN 16–20: HR, 0.73; P=0.004, eLN 21–30: HR, 0.62; P<0.001, and eLN >30: HR, 0.58; P<0.001).
Conclusions: In the United States, the majority of node-negative gastrectomies include suboptimal eLN. In node-negative gastric cancer, greater LN retrieval appears to have therapeutic and prognostic value, irrespective of initial treatment, suggesting a survival benefit to meticulous lymphadenectomy."
903,Prognostic Value of Lymphovascular Invasion in Node-Negative Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma Patients Undergoing Radical Nephroureterectomy,Wen Liu,2019,연세대학교의과대학,"Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in patients treated with radicalnephroureterectomy (RNU) for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).
Materials and Methods: We collected data from 180 patients who were treated with RNU from 2005 to 2013 at our institution. TheKaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for univariate and multivariateanalyses.
Results: LVI was present in 28 patients (15.6%), which was associated with higher pathological tumor stage (p<0.001), tumor necrosis(p=0.012), lymph node metastasis (p=0.017) and multifocality (p=0.012). On multivariate analysis, LVI was an independentprognostic factor of recurrence-free survival [RFS: hazard ratio (HR)=2.954; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.539–5.671; p=0.001]and cancer-specific survival (CSS: HR=3.530; 95% CI=1.701–7.325; p=0.001) in all patients. In patients with node-negative UTUC,LVI was also a significant predictor of RFS (HR=3.732; 95% CI 1.866–7.464; p<0.001) and CSS (HR=3.825; 95% CI=1.777–8.234;p=0.001).
Conclusion: LVI status was an independent predictor in patients with UTUC who underwent RNU. The estimate of LVI couldhelp physicians identify high-risk patients and make a better medication regimen of adjuvant chemotherapy."

The aim of the study was to compare apnea and hypopnea indices using different scoring recommendations. Methods: We retrospectively selected total 60 patients who were diagnosed with OSA syndrome. All sleep-related parameters including apnea index, hypopnea index, and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were measured by two different criteria; 1999 Chicago criteria and 2007 American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria for scoring respiratory events. Results: Apnea index and AHI by Chicago criteria were significantly higher than those by AASM criteria (mean 21.0/hr vs. 15.1/hr, p<0.001; mean 36.8/hr vs. 29.4/hr, p<0.001, respectively). But hypopnea index was not different between two criteria. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated a median (5th, 95th percentiles) reduction of 6.1/h (0.16, 20.57) when comparing AHI by AASM criteria to AHI by Chicago criteria. Conclusions: Our results suggested that AASM criteria intended to diagnose more confirmative OSA patients than Chicago criteria. Updated criteria may be stricter but possibly rule out mild OSA patients.1999 Chicago criteria, 2007 AASM criteria, Apnea-hypopnea index, Obstructive sleep apnea"
906,해양생태독성 평가용 표준시험생물로서 섬모충류Mesodinium rubrum에 대한 연구,안경호,2011,한국환경과학회,"The mixotrophic marine ciliate Mesodinium rubrum possesses a highly modified algal endosymbiont as a nutrition source for the species. Accordingly, we assumed that the species can reflect the ecotoxicity on marine producer (as phytoplankton) and consumer (as zooplankton) both. A series of experiments were conducted to identify the potential of the species as a standard test species for marine ecotoxicological study. The comparison of species sensitivity on reference toxic materials was made using potassium dichromate for phytoplankton and copper chloride for zooplankton. The ciliate revealed the highest sensitivity on both reference materials among the seven test species including phytoplankton, benthic copepod and rotifer species. The toxicity end point of the species was 72hr-EC_(50)=1.52 mg/L (as potassium dichromate) estimated by population growth inhibition (PGI), which is more sensitive than the most sensitive phytoplankton Skeletonema costatum (72hr-EC_(50)=3.05 mg/L). As comparison to rotifer, it also revealed higher sensitivity on copper chloride; 72hr-EC_(50)=0.38 mg/L for ciliate and 48hr-EC_(50)=0.48 mg/L for rotifer. Also, the elutriate toxicity test of various ocean disposal wastes were conducted to identify the potential of ciliate toxicity test application using industrial waste sludges. The toxicity of leather processing waste sludge was highest on the ciliate, followed by dyeing waste sludge and dye production waste sludge as an increasing order of toxicity. 72h-EC_(50) of ciliate PGI test was 1.83% and that of S. costatum 3.84% for leather waste sludge which showed highest toxicity. The toxicity test results also revealed that the highest sensitivity was observed on ciliate species on ocean disposed sludge wastes. Also, ciliate toxicity test well discriminated the degree of toxicity between sludge sources; 72h-EC_(50) values were 1.83% for leather processing waste sludge, 16.75% for dye production waste sludge and 27.75% for textile production waste sludge. Even the laboratory culture methods of the species were not generally established yet, the species has high potential as the standard test species for marine toxicity test in terms of the dual reflection of phyto- and zooplankton toxicity from single test, sensitivity and test replicability."

Materials and Methods: A total of 110 cylindrical specimens of RMTA were divided into 6 experimental groups as follows: Group1, RMTA; Group 2, RMTA modified with CaCl2 (RMTA-C); Group 3, RMTA modified with Na2HPO4 (RMTA-N); Group 4, RMTA contaminated with blood; Group 5, RMTA-C contaminated with blood; Group 6, RMTA-N contaminated with blood. The CS of specimens in all groups was evaluated after 3hr, 24 hr, and 1 wk. In the modified groups (groups 2, 3, 5, and 6) the CS of five specimens per group was also evaluated after 1 hr. Results: Blood contamination significantly reduced the CS of all materials at all time intervals (p < 0.05). After 3hr, the CS of specimens in the RMTA groups (with and without blood contamination)was significantly lower than those in the RMTA-C and RMTA-N groups (p < 0.05). The CS values were not significantly different at the other time intervals. In all groups,the CS of specimens significantly increased over time (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Blood contamination decreased the CS of both original and accelerated RMTA. (Restor Dent Endod 2013;38(3):128-133)"
909,Morning Spot Urine Glucose-to-Creatinine Ratios Predict Overnight Urinary Glucose Excretion in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,김소라,2017,대한진단검사의학회,"Background: With the advent of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors to control glucose and treat diabetes, laboratory data aided by either timed or spot glucose levels in the urine could be used as an alternative marker of drug response. The aim of this study was to assess the agreement between overnight urinary glucose excretion (UGE) and morning spot urinary glucose-to-creatinine ratio (UGCR).
Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study, we enrolled a total of 215 participants with either normal glucose tolerance (NGT), pre-diabetes, or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To exclude external factors such as food intake and physical activity, urine samples collected overnight at an 8-hr interval and the first-voided morning spot urine were collected and compared.
Results: The median values of overnight 8-hr UGE in participants with NGT (N=14), pre-diabetes (N=41), and T2DM (N=160) were 35.0 mg, 35.6 mg, and 653.4 mg, respectively. In participants with T2DM, the median values of overnight 8-hr UGCR and first-voided morning spot UGCR (M-UGCR) were 1.37 mg/mg and 0.16 mg/mg, respectively. Quantitative analyses using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) demonstrated a good reliability of measurement of the overnight 8-hr UGCR and M-UGCR (ICC=0.943, P<0.001). The M-UGCR was also significantly related to the overnight 8-hr UGE (r=0.828, P<0.001).
Conclusions: M-UGCR and overnight 8-hr UGCR showed good agreement, suggesting that M-UGCR be used as a simple index for estimating overnight amounts of UGE in patients with T2DM."

A total of 119 patients (130 hips, 63 hips CKD group, 67 hips non-CKD) who underwent hip fracture surgery were included. We assessed variables including age, gender, CKD, comorbidities, operation delay and operation time as risk factors for survival and complications after hip fracture surgery. The survival rate was 55.8% at 1-year, 45.8% at 3-year, and 31.4% at 5-year in CKD group, whereas 82.1%, 60.7%, and 36.8%, respectively in non-CKD. Age (more than 85) (hazard ratio [HR], 3.238; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.736–6.042; P < 0.001), stages 4, 5 of CKD (HR, 2.004; 95% CI, 1.170–3.433; P = 0.001), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 2.213; 95% CI, 1.196–4.095; P = 0.001), and malignancy (HR, 3.086; 95% CI, 1.553–6.129; P = 0.001) were significant risk factors. Complications occurred in 17 hips of CKD group and 8 hips of non-CKD. Stage 4–5 of CKD (odds ratio [OR], 3.401; 95% CI, 1.354–8.540; P = 0.001), malignancy (OR, 3.184; 95% CI, 0.984–10.301; P = 0.050) were significant risk factor. When performing hip fracture surgery in patients with CKD, surgeons should consider age, severity of CKD, and presence of other comorbid disease, such as cerebrovascular disease and malignancy, as patients with these risk factors will need more intensive preoperative and postoperative care."
911,Association of proton pump inhibitor use with renal outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease,조남준 /Cho Nam-Jun,2018,대한신장학회,"Background: Several studies have suggested that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is associated with adverse renal outcomes, but obvious evidence for this association is lacking. We investigated the association between PPI use and adverse renal outcomes in patients who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention.
Methods: Of the 1,284 patients hospitalized for percutaneous coronary intervention between January 2007 and May 2012, 934 patients with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were enrolled. Multivariable Cox models were used to examine whether PPI use was associated with acute and chronic adverse renal outcomes.
Results: In adjusted time-dependent Cox models, PPI use was associated with acute kidney injury (hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05-2.02), especially in patients aged 65 years or younger (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.09−3.96) or in patients with diabetes (HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.23-3.25). In multivariable Cox models, the association between duration of PPI use and chronic kidney disease development was not statistically significant (HR of heavy users, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.61-3.67), but a longer duration of PPI use was associated with mild renal progression in patients younger than 65 years (HR of heavy users, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.09-4.60).
Conclusion: Our results suggest that PPI use increases the risk of AKI development, and that PPI use is more significantly associated with acute and chronic renal injuries in younger patients."
912,"Age-specific predictors of cervical dysplasia recurrence after primary conization: analysis of 3,212 women",Giorgio Bogani,2020,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: This study aimed to identify predictors of recurrence/persistence of cervicalintraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) lesion (r-CIN2+) after primary conization.
Methods: Retrospective analysis involving all consecutive women having conization for CIN2+between 1998 and 2018. The risk of r-CIN2+ was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox models.
Results: Data of 3,212 women were retrospectively identified. After a mean follow-up of 47(±22.2) months, 112 (3.5%) patients developed r-CIN2+. Mean time interval between priorconization and diagnosis of r-CIN2+ was 26.2 (±13.2) months. Via multivariate analysis,presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types at the time of CIN2+ diagnosis,hazard ratio (HR)=3.40 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.66–6.95) for HPV16/18 and HR=2.59(95% CI=1.21–5.55) for HPV types other than 16/18, positive margins at primary conization,HR=4.11 (95% CI=2.04–8.26) and HPV persistence after conization, HR=16.69 (95%CI=8.20–33.9), correlated with r-CIN2+, independently. Considering age-specific HPV typesdistribution, we observed that HPV16/18 infection correlated to an increased risk of r-CIN2+only in young women (aged ≤25 years; p=0.031, log-rank test); while in the older population(>25 years) HPV type(s) involved had not impact on r-CIN2+ risk (p>0.200, log-rank test).
Conclusion: HPV persistence is the main factor predicting r-CIN2+. Infection from HPV16/18has a detrimental effect in young women, thus highlighting the need of implementingvaccination against HPV in this population. Further prospective studies are warranted fortailoring clinical decision-making for post-conization follow-up on the basis of risk factors."
913,Effect of Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate on Innate Immune Function of Canine Peripheral Blood Phagocytes,박무림,2008,한국임상수의학회,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most widely used immunosuppressive agents, but animals treated with GCs
may experience deleterious side effects which limit their use in many clinical conditions. In the present study, we
examined whether methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS), a glucocorticoid, modulates circulating leukocyte
numbers, phagocytic capacity and oxidative burst activity (OBA) of canine peripheral blood phagocytes, and whether
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) release is affected by MPSS injection. Neutrophilia and monocytosis were induced
by the administration of a high dose of MPSS, which is the recommended protocol for canine patients with acute
spinal cord injury. The injection of MPSS decreased the phagocytic capacity of canine PMNs but not PBMCs, and
recovered 12 hours (hr) after the completion of MPSS dosing. The OBA of both PMNs and PBMCs was suppressed
by MPSS, and restored 24 hr after the completion of dosing. The lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α release by PBMCs
but not PMNs exposed to MPSS was reduced 12 hr after the completion of dosing, and recovered 48 hr after the
completion of dosing. These results suggest that the application of MPSS protocol inhibits the innate immune functions

914,생물막반응조를 이용한 퍼클로레이트 처리에서 EBCT의 영향,이태룡 /Tae-Ryong Lee,2011,한국수처리학회,"Perchlorate contamination generates from the disposal of ammonium perchlorate(AP), a highly energetic compound produced for use in solid rocket propellant of missile. Typical water treatment technologies such as ion exchange, carbon adsorption, and air stripping seem not to be economical for perchlorate removal, which is extremely stable in water and does not react to adsorbents. Biofilm processes have been considered as a cost effective treatment for perchlorate and other anions. The purpose of this research was to investigate the optimum EBCT in a fixed biofilm reactor for destruction of perchlorate. A synthetic water containing average 277μg/L perchlorate was reduced to 40μg/L, 8μg/L, 10μg/L, and 52μg/L perchlorate at 5.4hr, 2.7hr, 1.4hr, and 0.5hr of EBCT in a fixed biofilm reactor. A fixed biofilm reactor with internal recirculation(2:1) reduced perchlorate from 277μg/L to below detection, 4μg/L, 11μg/L, and 47μg/L at 5.4hr, 2.7hr, 1.4hr, and 0.5hr EBCT. Perchlorate removal efficiencies in a plug flow biofilm reactor and internal recirculation biofilm reactor were not significantly different during this experiment."
915,Sex Factors in the Metabolic Syndrome as a Predictor of Cardiovascular Disease,서성환 /SUH SUNGHWAN,2014,대한내분비학회,"Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a condition characterized by a cluster of metabolic disorders and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study analyzed data from the Korean Health and Genome Study to examine the impact of MetS on CVD.
Methods: A total of 8,898 subjects (4,241 males and 4,657 females), 40 to 69 years of age, were enrolled and evaluated for the development of new onset CVD from 2001 to 2012 (median 8.1 years of follow-up).
Results: The prevalence of MetS at baseline was 22.0% (932/4,241) and 29.7% (1,383/4,657) in males and females, respectively. MetS was associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD; hazard ratio [HR], 1.818; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.312 to 2.520 in males; HR, 1.789; 95% CI, 1.332 to 2.404 in females) and CVD (HR, 1.689; 95% CI, 1.295 to 2.204 in males; HR, 1.686; 95% CI, 1.007 to 2.192 in females). Specifically, MetS was associated with risk of future stroke in females only (HR, 1.486; 95% CI, 1.007 to 2.192). Among MetS components, abdominal obesity and hypertension were independent predictors of both CHD and CVD. In addition, a higher number of MetS components correlated with higher CVD risk.
Conclusion: MetS is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD although its impact varies between sexes."
916,"Diabetes Medication Use in Association with Survival among Patients of Breast, Colorectal, Lung, or Gastric Cancer",Michelle L. Baglia,2019,대한암학회,"Purpose Studies suggest that regular use of metformin may decrease cancer mortality. We investigated the association between diabetes medication use and cancer survival.
Materials and Methods The current study includes 633 breast, 890 colorectal, 824 lung, and 543 gastric cancer cases identified from participants of two population-based cohort studies in Shanghai.
Information on diabetes medication use was obtained by linking to electronic medical records. The associations between diabetes medication use (metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin) and overall and cancer-specific survival were evaluated using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models.
Results After adjustment for clinical characteristics and treatment factors, use of metformin was associated with better overall survival among colorectal cancer patients (hazards ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34 to 0.88) and for all four types of cancer combined (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.98). Ever use of insulin was associated with worse survival for all cancer types combined (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.57 to 2.29) and for the four cancer types individually. Similar associations were seen for diabetic patients. Sulfonylureas use was associated with worse overall survival for breast or gastric cancer (HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.22 to 6.80 and HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.84, respectively) among diabetic patients. Similar association patterns were observed between diabetes medication use and cancer-specific survival.
Conclusion Metformin was associated with improved survival among colorectal cancer cases, while insulin use was associated with worse survival among patients of four major cancers. Further investigation on the topic is needed given the potential translational impact of these findings."
917,The maternal prepregnancy body mass index and the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Ensiyeh Jenabi,2019,대한소아청소년과학회,"Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms have a major impact on individuals, families, and society. Therefore identification risk factors of ADHD are a public health priority.
Purpose: This is meta-analysis evaluated the association between maternal prepregnancy body mass index and the risk of ADHD among the resulting offspring.
Methods: The search identified studies published through December 2018 in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) extracted from eligible studies were used as the common measure of association among studies.
Results: A significant association was found between overweight women and the risk of ADHD among children with the pooled HR and OR estimates (HR, 1.27 and 95% CI, 1.17–1.37; OR, 1.28 and 95% CI, 1.15–1.40, respectively). This association was significant between obese women and the risk of ADHD among children and adolescents with the pooled estimates of HR and OR (HR, 1.65 and 95% CI, 1.55–1.76; OR, 1.42 and 95% CI, 1.23–1.61).
Conclusion: The current epidemiological studies present sufficient evidence that prepregnancy overweight and obesity are significantly associated with an increased risk of ADHD among children and adolescents. These findings provide a new approach to preventing ADHD by controlling weight gain in the prenatal period, which should be considered by policymakers."
918,Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1) and ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M1 (RRM1) expression; do they have survival impact to pancreatic cancer?,Dae Wook Hwang,2020,한국간담췌외과학회,"Backgrounds/Aims: Gemcitabine is still one of adjuvant options in chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Integral membrane transporter protein and intracellular enzymes including human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), ribonucleotide reductase (RR) M1, and M2 are known as important factors for chemosensitivity of gemcitabine. We aimed to investigate the correlation between these key molecules and 5-year actual survival in PDAC patients. Methods: The expression of intratumoral hENT1, dCK, RRM1, and RRM2 was assessed immunohistochemically in 160 PDAC patients underwent surgical resection. Association between clininopathologic factors, immunohistochemical results, and overall survival were analyzed. Results: Adjuvant chemotherapy including concurrent chemoradiotherapy was not associated with overall survival (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.65-1.31; p=0.658). High hENT1 expression group did not show statistical survival difference, compared with all others (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.82-1.65, p=0.396). Gemcitabine therapy and high hENT1 group was compared with all other patients, and no difference in overall survival was identified (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68-1.42; p=0.940). And, gemcitabine therapy and high hENT1 group did not differ statistically from gemcitabine therapy and low hENT1 expression (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.55-1.56; p=0.764). The intensity of dCK, RRM1, and RRM2 expression was not associated with overall survival (p=0.413, p=0.138 and p=0.061) in univariate analysis. Conclusions: The expression of hENT1, dCK, RRM1 and RRM2 may not be associated with overall survival for patients with pancreatic cancer on gemcitabine adjuvant therapy. These proteins and other factors that may interact with or confound these results should be investigated in the near future."
919,"Nomograms for Prediction of Disease Recurrence in Patients with Primary Ta, T1 Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder",홍성준 /Hong Sung Joon,2008,대한의학회,"We developed nomograms to predict disease recurrence in patients with Ta, T1 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Thirty-eight training hospitals participated in this retrospective multicenter study. Between 1998 and 2002, a total of 1,587 patients with newly diagnosed non-muscle invasive bladder cancer were enrolled in this study. Patients with prior histories of bladder cancer, non-transitional cell carcinoma, or a follow-up duration of less than 12 months were excluded. With univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, we constructed nomograms to predict disease recurrence, and internal validation was performed using statistical techniques. Three-year and five-year recurrence-free rates were 64.3% and 55.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (hazard ratio [HR]=1.437, p< 0.001), tumor size (HR=1.328, p=0.001), multiplicity (HR=1.505, p<0.001), tumor grade (HR=1.347, p=0.007), concomitant carcinoma in situ (HR=1.611, p=0.007), and intravesical therapy (HR=0.681, p<0.001) were independent predictors for disease recurrence. Based on these prognostic factors, nomograms for the prediction of disease recurrence were developed. These nomograms can be used to predict the probability of disease recurrence in patients with newly diagnosed Ta, T1 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. They may be useful for patient counseling, clinical trial design, and patient follow-up planning."
920,The Impact of Local and Regional Recurrence on Distant Metastasis and Survival in Patients Treated with Breast Conservation Therapy,이종석 /Jong Seok Lee,2011,한국유방암학회,"Purpose: We evaluated the effect of local recurrence (LR) and regional recurrence (RR) on distant metastasis and survival in patients treated with breast conservation therapy (BCT). Methods: We analyzed 907 patients who were treated for invasive breast cancer between 1993 and 2006. With 53 months of follow-up, 28 patients (3.1%) developed LR in the breast and 12 patients (1.3%) developed RR before distant metastasis. LR and RR were separated into four patterns to determine the prognostic relevance of recurrence site and time to recurrence: LR within 3 years (early LR), LR after 3 years (late LR), RR within 3 years (early RR), and RR after 3 years (late RR). Results: Early LR (hazard ratio [HR], 4.76; p=0.003) and early RR (HR, 18.16; p<0.001) were independent predictors of distant metastasis. In terms of overall survival, early LR (HR, 5.24; p=0.002), and early RR (HR, 18.80; p<0.001) were significantly related with poor survival. Patients with late LR/RR had a similar favorable prognosis compared with patients who never experienced LR/RR. Conclusion: The result suggests that time to LR/RR following BCT is a significant predictor developing a distant metastasis and surviving."
921,Endocrine Treatment-Related Symptoms and Patient Outcomes in Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis,YOO TAE KYUNG R /Tae-Kyung Yoo,2018,한국유방암학회,"Purpose: An association between endocrine treatment-related symptoms and breast cancer recurrence has been suggested previously; however, conflicting results have been reported. We performed a meta-analysis of published studies to clarify this relationship.
Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane database for studies investigating the association between endocrine treatment-related symptoms and patient survival. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted with recurrence rate as the primary outcome.
Results: Out of 7,713 retrieved articles, six studies were included.
In patients who received endocrine treatment, the presence of any endocrine treatment-related symptom was found to be associated with a lower recurrence rate in comparison to an absence of any symptoms (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66–0.87). This relationship persisted in patients presenting with only vasomotor or only musculoskeletal symptoms (HR, 0.74, 95% CI, 0.63–0.87; HR, 0.69, 95% CI, 0.55–0.86, respectively). At both time-points of symptom evaluation (3 months and 12 months), patients with endocrine treatment- related symptoms had a lower recurrence rate (HR, 0.74, 95% CI, 0.66–0.84; HR, 0.79, 95% CI, 0.69–0.90, respectively).
This association was also significant in pooled studies including patients with and without baseline symptoms (HR, 0.73, 95% CI, 0.54–0.99; HR, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.69–0.85, respectively).
Conclusion: Endocrine treatment-related symptoms are significantly predictive of lower recurrence rate in breast cancer patients, regardless of the type of symptoms, time-point of evaluation, or inclusion of baseline symptoms. These symptoms could be biomarkers for the prediction of long-term responses to endocrine treatment in patients with breast cancer."
922,인공강우기 기반 확률강우재현을 통한 식생유니트형 LID시스템의 우수유출지연 효과분석,김태한 /KIM TAE HAN,2019,한국환경복원기술학회,"In a climate change environment where heat damage and drought occur during a rainy season such as in 2018, a vegetation-based LID system that enables disaster prevention as well as environment im- provement is suggested in lieu of an installation-type LID system that is limited to the prevention of floods. However, the quantification of its performance as against construction cost is limited. This study aims to present an experiment environment and evaluation method on quantitative performance, which is required in order to disseminate the vegetation-based LID system. To this end, a 3 rd quartile huff time distribution mass curve was generated for 20-year frequency, 60-minute probable rainfall of 68mm/hr in Cheonan, and effluent was analyzed by recreating artificial rainfall. In order to assess the reliability of the rainfall event simulator, 10 repeat tests were conducted at one-minute intervals for 20 minutes with minimum rainfall intensity of 22.29mm/hr and the maximum rainfall intensity of 140.69mm/hr from the calculated probable rainfall. Effective rainfall as against influent flow was 21.83mm/hr (sd=0.17~1.36, n=20) on average at the minimum rainfall intensity and 142.27mm/hr (sd=1.02~3.25, n=20) on average at the maximum rainfall intensity. In artificial rainfall recreation ex- periments repeated for three times, the most frequent quartile was found to be the third quartile, which is around 40 minutes after beginning the experiment. The peak flow was observed 70 minutes after beginning the experiment in the experiment zone and after 50 minutes in the control zone. While the control zone recorded the maximum runoff intensity of 2.26mm/min(sd=0.25) 50 minutes after begin- ning the experiment, the experiment zone recorded the maximum runoff intensity of 0.77mm/min (sd=0.15) 70 minutes after beginning the experiment, which is 20 minutes later than the control zone.
Also, the maximum runoff intensity of the experiment zone was 79.6% lower than that of the control zone, which confirmed that vegetation unit-type LID system had rainfall runoff reduction and delay effects. Based on the above findings, the reliability of a lab-level rainfall simulator for monitoring the vegetation-based LID system was reviewed, and maximum runoff intensity reduction and runoff time delay were confirmed. As a result, the study presented a performance evaluation method that can be applied to the pre-design of the vegetation-based LID system for rainfall events on a location before construction."

Methods: A total of 14 161 subjects of the Korean Multi-center Cancer Cohort who were over 40 years of age and who were cancer-free at baseline enrollment reported their lifestyle factors, including the smoking status. The median follow-up time was 6.6 years. During the follow-up period from 1993 to 2005, we identified 1159 cases of mortality, including 260 cancer mortality cases with a total of 91 987 person-years, by the national death certificate. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of cigarette smoking for total mortality, cancer mortality and disease-specific mortality, as adjusted for age, gender, the geographic area and year of enrollment, the alcohol consumption status, the education level and the body mass index (BMI).
Results: Cigarette smoking was significantly associated with an increased risk of total mortality, all-cancer mortality and lung cancer mortality (p-trend, < 0.01, <0.01, <0.01, respectively). Compared to non-smoking, current smokers were at a higher risk for mortality [HR (95% CI)=1.3 (1.1 - 1.5) for total mortality; HR (95% CI)=1.6 (1.1 -2.2) for all-cancer mortality; HR (95%CI)=3.9 (1.9-7.7) for lung cancer mortality].
Conclusions: This study’s results suggest that cigarette smoking might be associated with total mortality, all-cancer mortality and especially lung cancer mortality among Korean adults."

The study was conducted at 4 restrooms in and outside the radionuclide facility of a general hospital in Incheon between May 1 and July 31, 2014. During the study period, the spatial contamination dose rate and the surface contamination dose rate before and after radiation use were measured at the 4 places− thyroid therapy room, PET center, gamma camera room, and outpatient department. According to the restroom use survey by hospitals, restrooms in the radionuclide facility were used not only by patients but also by family care-givers and some of radiation workers. The highest cumulative spatial radiation dose rate was 8.86 mSv/hr at camera room restroom, followed by 7.31 mSv/hr at radioactive iodine therapy room restroom, 2.29 mSv/hr at PET center restroom, and 0.26 mSv/hr at outpatient department restroom, respectively. The surface radiation dose rate measured before and after radiation use was the highest at toilets, which are in direct contact with patient's excretion, followed by the center and the entrance of restrooms. Unsealed radioactive sources used in nuclear medicine are relatively safe due to short half lives and low energy. A patient who received those radioactive sources, however, may become a mobile radioactive source and contaminate areas the patient contacts−camera room, sedation room, and restroom−through secretion and excretion. Therefore, patients administered radionuclides should be advised to drink sufficient amounts of water to efficiently minimize radiation exposure to others by reducing the biological half-life, and members of the public−family care-givers, pregnant women, and children−be as far away from the patients until the dose remains below the permitted dose limit.Surface radiation dose rate, Space radiation dose rate"
927,한국 성인의 혈중 알코올 제거율 및 관련 인자에 대한 Spaghetti Plot을 이용한 재분석 및 예측 모델,이중석 /Joongsuk Lee,2019,한국중독정신의학회,"Objectives ： Alcohol-related pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and related factors in Korean male and female were reported respectively in our previous works, but they lacked methodological validity. We recalculated more reliable parameters including the volume of distribution (Vd) and blood alcohol elimination rate (β-value) and examined the potential of predictive models using new analytic techniques.
Methods ： Out of 101 men and 91 women, 66 men and 65 women were selected for the final data analysis. New PK parameters were obtained from redrawn blood alcohol concentration (BAC)-time spaghetti plots for every subject. Regression analyses were used to determine β-values and predictive models for Vd and β-value.
Results ： For men, β-value was 0.147±0.045 g/L/hr and ranged between 0.050-0.240 g/L/hr, for women it was 0.155±0.047 g/L/hr and ranged between 0.060-0.270 g/L/hr, demonstrating a significant difference after adjustment for age, past drinking behavior, and smoking. Influence of alcohol dose on β-value was not significant. Vd was significantly predicted by height, weight and sex multifactorially (R2=0.562, p＜0.001), and body fat ratio monofactorially (R2=0.812, p＜0.001). β-value was significantly predicted by sex, weight, total body water, and past drinking behavior (R2=0.706, p＜0.001).
Conclusion : Using new analytic methods, we updated alcohol related PK parameters and investigated the influence of related factors on Vd and β-value with predictive models. It is expected that the outcomes of this study could be a contribution to a more precise BAC estimation in forensic psychiatry fields.Alcohol drinking, Blood alcohol contents, Metabolic clearance rate, Pharmacokinetics, Regression analysis"
928,"The Independent Effects of Cigarette Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, and Serum Aspartate Aminotransferase on the Alanine Aminotransferase Ratio in Korean Men for the Risk for Esophageal Cancer",김희진 /kim， Hee Jin,2010,연세대학교의과대학,"Purpose: The goal of this study is to assess the interactions among alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratios on esophageal cancer. Materials and Methods:Alcohol and the risk of incidence and death from esophageal cancer were examined in a 14-year prospective cohort study of 782,632 Korean men, 30 to 93years of age, who received health insurance from the National Health Insurance Corporation and had a medical evaluation from 1992 to 1995. Results: Smoking,alcohol intake, and AST/ALT ratios were associated with the increased risk of esophageal cancer in a dose-dependent manner independent of each other.
Smoking was associated with an increased risk of incidence [Hazard ratio (HR) =2.2, 95% CI = 1.8 to 2.5] and mortality (HR = 2.5, 2.0 to 3.1). Combined HR of incidence for alcohol consumption (> 25 g/day) and smoking was 4.5 (3.8-5.5); for alcohol (> 25 g/day) and the AST/ALT ratio (≥ 2.0), it was 5.8 (4.6-7.2); for smoking and the AST/ALT ratio (≥ 2.0), it was 6.3 (5.1-7.5). Similar results were seen for mortality from esophageal cancer. Subjects who drank ≥ 25 g/day with an AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2 had a higher risk of esophageal cancer incidence (HR = 6.5, 4.8to 8.7) compared with those who drank ≥ 25 g/day with an AST/ALT ratio < 2(HR = 2.2, 1.9 to 2.6). Conclusion: Alcohol, smoking, and the AST/ALT ratio are independently associated with increased risk of esophageal cancer but did not interact synergistically. The combination of the AST/ALT ratio with a questionnaire for alcohol consumption may increase the effectiveness for determining the risk of esophageal cancer."
929,Concurrent Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonist Administration with Chemotherapy Improves Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Responses in Young Premenopausal Breast Cancer Patients,김희정 /hi jong kim,2015,한국유방암학회,"Purpose: This study aimed to determine the oncologic efficacy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist treatment concurrent with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant setting. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 332 cases of invasive breast cancer in patients who were <40 years old at diagnosis and received GnRH agonists concurrent with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (GnRH agonist group) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (neochemotherapy-alone group) from December 2010 to September 2014. Pathologic complete response rates (pCR) and Ki-67 changes were evaluated between the two groups. Results: Median age was 32±3.9 and 36±3.0 years in the GnRH agonist group and neochemotherapy-alone group, respectively (p<0.001). After adjustment for tumor size, grade, lymph node metastasis, hormone receptor (HR) status, and chemotherapy regimen, the GnRH agonist group exhibited a higher pCR rate with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.98 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37–6.34) and a greater decrease in Ki-67 expression after treatment (p=0.05) than the neochemotherapy-alone group. For HR-negative tumors, the GnRH agonist group showed a higher pCR rate (multivariate OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.37–8.95) and a greater decrease in Ki-67 expression (p=0.047). For HR-positive breast cancer, the pCR rate, change in Ki-67 index, and clinical response were higher, and preoperative endocrine prognostic index scores were lower, in the GnRH agonist group, but these did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Concurrent administration of GnRH agonists during neoadjuvant chemotherapy improved pCR rates and suppressed Ki-67 expression, especially in HR-negative tumors."

This study was performed to identify the clinical predictors of the MCI progression in a Korean registry,and investigated the effects of medications without evidence, frequently prescribed in clinical practice.
Methods Using a Korean cohort that included older adults with MCI who completed at least one follow-up visit, clinical characteristics andtotal medical expenses including prescribed medications were compared between two groups: progressed to dementia or not. Cox proportionalhazards regression analysis was conducted.
Results During the mean 1.42±0.72 years, 215 (27.63%) of 778 participants progressed to dementia. The best predictors were age [hazardratio (HR), 1.036; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.006–1.067; p=0.018], apolipoprotein ε4 allele (HR, 2.247; 95% CI, 1.512–3.337; p<0.001),Clinical Dementia Rating scale-sum of boxes scores (HR, 1.367; 95% CI, 1.143–1.636; p=0.001), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores(HR, 1.035; 95% CI, 1.003–1.067; p=0.029), and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores (HR, 0.892; 95% CI, 0.839–0.949; p<0.001).

931,Interaction between Trichomonas vaginalis and the Prostate Epithelium,김정현 /Kim， Jeong Hyun,2017,대한기생충학ㆍ열대의학회,"Most men infected with Trichomonas vaginalis are asymptomatic and can remain undiagnosed and untreated. This has been hypothesized to result in chronic persistent prostatic infection. Adhesion of the protozoan organisms to mucosal cells is considered a first and prerequisite step for T. vaginalis infection. Adhesion of T. vaginalis to prostate epithelial cells has not yet been observed; however, there are several reports about inflammation of prostate epithelial cells induced by T. vaginalis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether adhesion and cytotoxicity of T. vaginalis are involved in inflammation of prostate epithelial cells. When RWPE-1 cells were infected with T. vaginalis (1:0.4 or 1:4), adhesion of T. vaginalis continuously increased for 24 hr or 3 hr, respectively. The cytotoxicity of prostate epithelial cells infected with T. vaginalis (RWPE-1: T. vaginalis=1:0.4) increased at 9 hr; at an infection ratio of 1:4, cytotoxicity increased after 3 hr. When the RWPE-1 to T. vaginalis ratio was 1:0.4 or 1:4, production of IL-1β, IL-6, CCL2, and CXCL8 also increased. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was verified by measuring decreased E-cadherin and increased vimentin expression at 24 hr and 48 hr. Taken together, the results indicate that T. vaginalis adhered to prostate epithelial cells, causing cytotoxicity, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and EMT. Our findings suggest for the first time that T. vaginalis may induce inflammation via adhesion to normal prostate epithelial cells."
932,"Association of Insulin, Metformin, and Statin with Mortality in Breast Cancer Patients",최미홍 /Mihong Choi,2021,대한암학회,"Purpose This study investigated the association of insulin, metformin, and statin use with survival and whether the association was modified by the hormone receptor status of the tumor in patients with breast cancer.
Materials and Methods We studied 7,452 patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer at Seoul National University Hospital from 2008 to 2015 using the nationwide claims database. Exposure was defined as a recorded prescription of each drug within 12 months before the diagnosis of breast cancer.
Results Patients with prior insulin or statin use were more likely to be older than 50 years at diagnosis and had a higher comorbidity index than those without it (p < 0.01 for both). The hazard ratio (HR) for death with insulin use was 5.7 (p < 0.01), and the effect was attenuated with both insulin and metformin exposure with an HR of 1.2 (p=0.60). In the subgroup analyses, a heightened risk of death with insulin was further prominent with an HR of 17.9 (p < 0.01) and was offset by co-administration of metformin with an HR of 1.3 (p=0.67) in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)–negative breast cancer. Statin use was associated with increased overall mortality only in patients with ER-positive breast cancer with HR for death of 1.5 (p=0.05).
Conclusion Insulin or statin use before the diagnosis of breast cancer was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality. Subsequent analyses suggested that metformin or statin use may have been protective in patients with ER-negative disease, which warrants further studies."

934,The effect of nitroglycerin on hemodynamic changes during laparoscopic low anterior resection,문현수 /Moon Hyun Soo,2011,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: More laparoscopic low anterior resections (LAR) are being performed in recent years. There has been controversy around the hemodynamic changes affected by the Trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum during LAR. The goal of this study was to analyze the effect of nitroglycerin (NTG) on hemodynamic changes during LAR.
Methods: Forty ASA physical status I-II patients undergoing LAR were randomized into two groups: the NTG infused group (N group, n = 20) and the control group (C group, n = 20). Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane at 1-3 vol%, air/oxygen (50%/50%) and continuous infusion with remifentanil. The N group patients were given 0.5 μg/kg/min of NTG during anesthesia. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were assessed 10 min after induction (T1), 5 min after pneumoperitoneum in the supine position (T2), 10 min after pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg position (T3), 30 min after pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg position (T4), 1 hr after pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg position (T5) in addition to 5 (T6), 10 (T7) and 30 min (T8) after removal of the pneumoperitoneum in the supine position.
Results: The increases of MAP were milder in the N group (22.6-7.3%) than the C group (32.3-17.7%) during pneumoperitoneum and while in the Trendelenburg position. The significant decreases of HR were maintained in the C group, but the changes in HR were not significant in N group during the operation. The increases in CVP were less in N group than C group. The increases of SVR were milder in N group (19.4-1.4%) than C group (41.7-16.6%)during pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg position.
Conclusions: Intraoperative NTG infusions were effective to some degree in reducing the hemodynamic changes during pneumoperitoneum with Trendelenburg positioning for LAR."
935,Identification of Risk Factors Influencing In-Stent Restenosis with Acute Coronary Syndrome Presentation,조재영 /Jae young cho,2017,전남대학교 의과학연구소,"Although the angiographic rates of in-stent restenosis (ISR) at later months have reduced dramatically with the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DESs), some patients with ISR after implantation of DES present with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Here, we sought to identify parameters influencing the likelihood of restenosis with ACS presentation after DES implantation. Stented patients (n=3,817) with DESs in the Korea University Anam Hospital percutaneous coronary intervention registry were reviewed retrospectively for inclusion. In this database, 247 age- and sex-matched patients (6.5%) with ISR were allocated to either the Stable ISR group (n=78) or the ACS ISR group (n=73). Predictors of in-stent restenosis were identified with Cox regression analyses. Age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.27; p=0.026), diabetes (HR, 8.40; 95% CI, 1.30 to 54.1; p=0.025), use of aspirin (HR, 0.003; 95% CI, 0.0001 to 0.63; p=0.03), clopidogrel (HR, 0.005; 95% CI, 0.001 to 0.121; p=0.001), renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker (HR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.003 to 0.14; p＜0.001), use of first -generation DES (HR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.009 to 0.59; p=0.014), and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) levels (HR, 1.120; 95% CI, 1.001 to 1.190; p=0.004) during follow-up angiograms were significant predictors of ISR with ACS presentation during the 3 year follow-up. Age, diabetes, the use of first generation DES, and increased MMP-2 levels were significant predictors of ISR with ACS presentation; moreover, the use of aspirin, clopidogrel, RAS blocker, and the use of second generation DESs prevented ISR with ACS presentation."
936,Predictors of Institutionalization in Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease in South Korea,박동규,2018,대한신경과학회,"Background and Purpose We investigated predictors of institutionalization in patients withAlzheimer’s disease (AD) in South Korea.
Methods In total, 2,470 patients with AD aged 74.5±7.8 years (mean±standard deviation,68.1% females) were enrolled from November 2005 to December 2013. The dates of institutionalizationwere identified from the public Long-Term-Care Insurance program in January 2014.
We used a Cox proportional-hazards model to identify predictors for future institutionalizationamong characteristics at the time of diagnosis in 2,470 AD patients. A similar Cox proportionalhazardsmodel was also used to investigate predictors among variables that reflected longitudinalchanges in clinical variables before institutionalization in 816 patients who underwent follow-up testing.
Results A lower Mini Mental State Examination score [hazard ratio (HR)=0.95, 95% confidenceinterval (CI)=0.92–0.97] and higher scores for the Clinical Dementia Rating and Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory (HR=1.01, 95% CI=1.00–1.01) at baseline were independent predictors ofinstitutionalization. The relationship of patients with their main caregivers, presence of the apolipoproteinE e4 allele, and medication at baseline were not significantly associated with the rateof institutionalization. In models with variables that exhibited longitudinal changes, larger annualchange in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score (HR=1.15, 95% CI=1.06–1.23)and higher medication possession ratio of antipsychotics (HR=1.89, 95% CI=1.20–2.97) predictedearlier institutionalization.
Conclusions This study shows that among Korean patients with AD, lower cognitive ability,higher dementia severity, more-severe behavioral symptoms at baseline, more-rapid decline in dementiaseverity, and more-frequent use of antipsychotics are independent predictors of earlier institutionalization."
937,Characterizing the efficacy and trends of adjuvant therapy versus observation in women with early stage (uterine confined) leiomyosarcoma: a National Cancer Database study,Anthony B. Costales,2020,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: The utility of adjuvant therapy for women with uterine confined leiomyosarcoma remains uncertain. We sought to identify trends, analyze efficacy, and assess survival impact of adjuvant therapy in this patients.
Methods: We performed an observational cohort study of 1030 women with early stage leiomyosarcoma from the 2008–2014 National Cancer Database. Multi-nominal logistic regression was used to identify trends in receipt of adjuvant treatment. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival.
Results: There were 547 who (53.1%) received observation, 79 (7.7%) received radiation alone, 340 (33.0%) received chemotherapy alone, and 64 (6.2%) received chemoradiation. Patients were more likely to be observed if tumor size was <5 cm (hazard ratio [HR]=0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.95–0.99; p=0.017) and less likely to be observed if lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) was present (HR=0.60; 95% CI=0.41–0.89; p=0.010). Patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy if they were younger (HR=0.78; 95% CI=0.65–0.94; p=0.010) and if they had LVSI (HR=1.47; 95% CI=1.01–2.16; p=0.040). There was an independent association between older age, tumor size >5 cm, and LVSI with worsened survival, with the strongest predictor of mortality being the presence of LVSI. With a median survival of 61.9 months, there was no difference in estimated overall survival at 1 and 3 years based on receipt of adjuvant treatment as compared to observation (p=0.500).
Conclusion: Although women with uterine confined leiomyosarcoma experience high recurrence rates and poor survival outcomes, adjuvant treatment does not appear to confer a survival benefit."

Results: A total of 461 patients with acute cholangitis were included in this study. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models showed that higher B/A ratio on ED admission (day 1) (Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.182; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.076-1.298, p<0.001) and day 4 (HR: 1.192; 95% CI: 1.019-1.395, p=0.028) were independent risk factors for mortality at 28 days. Our study showed that the increased 28-day mortality was associated with a B/A ratio >6.83 on day 1 (HR: 4.065; 95% CI: 4.123-43.737, p<0.001) and a higher B/A ratio (>6.26) on day 4 (HR: 7.16; 95% CI: 1.412- 36.333, p=0.018) in patients with acute cholangitis.
Conclusion: The ratio of BUN to albumin on ED admission is a promising prognostic marker of 28-day mortality in patients with acute cholangitis."
940,A prediction model of survival for patients with bone metastasis from uterine cervical cancer,Hiroko Matsumiya,2016,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: The aim of the study was to establish a predictive model of survival period afterbone metastasis from cervical cancer.
Methods: A total of 54 patients with bone metastasis from cervical cancer were included in thestudy. Data at the time of bone metastasis diagnosis, which included presence of extraskeletalmetastasis, performance status, history of any previous radiation or chemotherapy, thenumber of bone metastases, onset period, and treatment were collected. Survival data wereanalyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model.
Results: The median survival period after diagnosis of bone metastasis was 22 weeks (5months). The 26- and 52-week survival rates after bone metastasis were 36.5% and 15.4%,respectively. Cox regression analysis showed that extraskeletal metastasis (hazard ratio [HR],6.1; 95% CI, 2.2 to 16.6), performance status of 3 to 4 (HR, 7.8; 95% CI, 3.3 to 18.2), previousradiation or chemotherapy (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.8), multiple bone metastases (HR, 1.9;95% CI, 1.0 to 3.5), and a bone metastasis-free interval of <12 months (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2to 5.3) were significantly and independently related to poor survival. A prognostic score wascalculated by adding the number of each significant factor. The 26-week survival rates afterdiagnosis of bone metastasis were 70.1% in the group with a score ≤2, 46.7% in the groupwith a score of 3, and 12.5% in the group with a score ≥4 (p<0.001).
Conclusion: This scoring system provided useful prognostic information on survival ofpatients with bone metastasis of cervical cancer."
941,Amikacin Pharmacokinetics and a New Dosing Guideline in Korean Neonates,안숙희,2006,한국병원약사회,"The objectives of this study is to evaluate the correlations between patient characteristics and amikacin pharmacokinetics, and develop a new dosing regimen for Korean neonates. This study was conducted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea, between February 2003 and February 2005. Demographic and pharmacokinetic data were collected for 107 neonates of 24 to 41 weeks` gestational age (GA) treated with amikacin and received therapeutic drug monitoring by a pharmacist. The medication was infused over 30 minutes and 268 serum amikacin concentrations (134 peak and trough pairs) were taken at steady state. The pharmacokinetic parameters of amikacin in the study population were as follows: Vd (0.56 ± 0.13 L/kg), t1/2 (6.6 ± 4.1 hr), K (0.14 ± 0.06 hr-1) and CL (0.07 ± 0.03 L kg-1 hr-1). CL (L kg-1 hr-1) significantly increased with body weight (CL = 1.795 × 10-5 × body weight + 0.038), postnatal age (CL = 0.001 × PNA + 0.057), postconceptional age (CL = 0.004 × PCA - 0.073) and decreased with serum creatinine (CL = -0.045 × Scr + 0.107) (P 0.001). The mean peak and trough concentrations were 26.9 ± 7.8 and 3.4 ± 3.3 μg/mL, respectively. The overall ratios within the therapeutic range of peak (20~30 μg/mL) and trough (2~5 μg/mL) were 50.8 and 44.8%, respectively. Compared to the current therapy, the dose was reduced from 15~18 mg/kg to 13 mg/kg in neonates with PNA ≤ 7 days while dose increased from 12 mg/kg to 13 mg/kg in neonates with PNA ≥ 8 days in the new dosing guideline. The dosing interval was prolonged from 24 to 36 hr in neonates with PCA ≤ 29 and PNA ≥ 8 days. CL was influenced by PCA and PNA, and a new dosing guideline was constructed based on the results."
942,Nitrous Oxide와 Remifentanil이 Desflurane 마취하 기관내삽관 시 심혈관계에 미치는 영향,홍진욱,2008,대한마취통증의학회,"Background: Desflurane is known to causes hypertension and
tachycardia when its inspired concentration is rapidly increased. We
determined whether nitrous oxide (N2O) or remifentanil alters cardiovascular
responses to intubation and/or inhalation of high concentrations
of desflurane during induction of anesthesia.
Methods: Sixty patients were assigned randomly into three groups
(n = 20 each). Anesthesia was induced with thiopental 5 mg/kg
followed by saline (control and N2O groups) or remifentanil 1μg/kg
(remifentanil group). Tracheal intubation was facilitated with intravenous
vecuronium 0.12 mg/kg and 12% desflurane was given soon
after the intubation. In addition, 75% N2O was given beginning 3
min before the intubation in the N2O group. Systolic arterial pressure
(SAP), heart rate (HR), and plasma catecholamine concentrations
were determined.
Results: The intubation resulted in an immediate increase and an
additional second increase of SAP and HR at 3 to 5 min after
intubation in all groups. SAP but not HR in the N2O group and
both SAP and HR in the remifentanil group at first and second peak
responses were lower than in the control group. Norepinephrine
increased at 1 min after intubation and increased further at 5 min
in the control and N2O groups but only increased at 5 min in the
remifentanil group.
Conclusions: A biphasic pressor and tachycardiac response in
response to intubation and desflurane were noted. Although N2O
did not affect tachycardiac response, it suppressed the pressor
responses and augmented norepinephrine release. However, remifentanil
significantly attenuated hemodynamic and catecholamine

Many researches demonstrated that regular physical activity reduce all cause mortality. To increase the physical activities of the population, accurate estimation of the activities is needed. Actical and actigraph are confirmed as accurate tools to measure physical activities. But the target populations of the validity studies were not Asian people. Therefore, the accuracy of the accelerometers should be confirmed in Asian people. The accuracy of the tools could be different. Therefore head to head comparison study between the tools would be needed. 
Methods: Thirty volunteers from the community, ages over 20 yrs, were recruited. The participants put on the two accelerometers (Actical, Actigraph) on the waists, secured with elastic belts, and performed a session of rest and three structured activities (two walking speeds, 4 km/hr and 6 km/hr, and one jogging speed, 8 km/hr). During each activity, expired respiratory gases were collected, and oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured by indirect calorimetry (Model Quark β2Ⓡ). The calories measured by gas analyzer and two accelerometers were compared by correlation analysis using SPSS program.
Results: Pearson correlation coefficient between gas analyzer and two accelerometers was calculated at three structured activities. The r in Actical was 0.747, 0.785, and 0.677, at speed of 4, 6, 8 km/hr, respectively (P＜0.05), and the same measures in Actigraph was 0.617, 0.737, and 0.530 (P＜0.05), respectively. Pearson correlation coefficient was also calculated between the two accelerometers, and the r was 0.881, 0.927, and 0.824, at each speed.

Many studies performed to construct optimum conditions of gene delivery into cells and tissues. In this study, we examined efficiency of gene delivery-complexed with cationic lipid vector in human cancer cell lines. GFP plasmids were complexed with cationic lipid and transfected into human cancer cell lines at different concentrations. And then, expression of GFP was analysed with fluorescent microscope and FACS. To determine efficiency of gene delivery, we investigated GFP expression level in various cancer cell lines. GFP expression cells were not shown in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and lung carcimona cell line A549 afterhe4hr transfection, wh ne, GFP expression cells were observed at 500ng concentration afterh48hr transfection. In colorectal carcinoma cell line HCTat6, GFP expression cells were observed at 100ng and 500ng concentrations afterhe4hr transfection and slightly increased at 48hr. Afterhtransfection into ovary adenocarcinoma cell line SKOV3, we could found that many cells expressed GFP at 500ng concentration afterhe4hr and highly elevated GFP expression cells afterh48hr. For further evaluate gene expression level, we confirmed GFP expression level by using FACS analysis afterh48hr transfection. As a result, HepG2 was expressed GFP in very low level at 10ng, 100ng, and 500ng concentrations. We also identified that GFP was expressed low level at 10ng and 100ng singCTat6 and A549, but highly increased at 500ng concentration to 14.19% and 16.57%, respectively. In case of SKOV3, GFP expression was highly elevated to 13.14% at 100ng and 58.10% at 500ng compared with 10ng transfection. By Comparing efficiency of gene expression among cancer cell lines, GFP expression was similar with cell lines at 10ng transfection, but significantly differed from cell lines at 500ng higher concentration. Additionally, GFP expression level of SKOV3 was showed about 10 fold higher than HepG2, and about 4 fold higher than HCT116 and A549 at 500ng. These results demonstrated that efficiency of gene delivery-complexed with cationic lipid vector was the highest in SKOV3, while HepG2 was showed the lowest efficiency. Taken together, we could determined that efficiency of gene delivery into cells differed from each human cancer cell lines. Our study suggest that cellular properties should be considered in gene delivery-complexed with cationic lipid vector to improve cellular expression efficiency of gene."

Ionomycin sequentially combined with 6-DMAP is now widely used to activate normal oocytes for analytical studies of oocyte activation and to activate reconstructed oocytes after nuclear transfer. The present study investigated sources of oocytes, duration of ionomycin and 6-DMAP, laser and electric stimulation in goat oocyte activation in order to optimize the protocols. Goat ovaries were collected in individual abattoirs during the breeding season and were delivered to the laboratory within 6 h in saline with 100 IU/ml streptomycin and 0.05 mg/ml penicillin. The oocytes were denuded from the cumulus cell by pipetting with 0.2% hyaluronidase in PBS at 20～22 hr post maturation. Oocytes with the polar body were selected and assigned to four groups for parthenogenetic activation. To examine the effect of duration of ionomycin treatment, oocytes after 20～22 hr of maturation were treated with 2.5 uM ionomycin for 1 or 5 min times and then cultured in 2 mM 6-DMAP for 2 or 4 hr. The activated oocytes were cultured in mSOF at 38.5℃ in CO25%, O2 5% and N2 90% multi incubator. Cleavage and blastocyst development was observed at 48 hr and day 8 of culture in vitro, respectively. Activation rates of oocytes exposed to ionomycin for 1 min(86.4%) were significantly higher than those treated for 5 min(74.3%) duration. This indicated that 1 min ionomycin treatment was most suitable for activation of goat oocytes. The duration of 6-DMAP treat duration was in 2 mM 6-DMAP for 2 hr after 1 min exposure to 2.5 uM ionomycin. The activation rate of oocytes incubated in 6-DMAP for 2 hour(82.5%) was significantly higher than those in oocytes treated with 4 hr(75.5%)."

Delayed onset muscle soreness was caused by the eccentric exercise in the elbow flexor muscle of the non-dominant upper limb. Forty-four subjects volunteered to participate in this study and were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: warm-up and cool-down group, only warm-up group, only cool-down group, or control group with no intervention. The level of perceived pain using the visual analogue scale and electromyographic activation change in maximal voluntary isometric contraction were measured 4 times at the following times: 10 min, 24 hr, 48 hr, and 72 hr after the exercise. The results revealed the main effect between the groups and interaction effect between the group and measurement session (p<.05). The warm-up and cool-down group showed most favorable results with respect to reduced perceived pain level and increased muscle strength in most measurement sessions, and the only warm-up group showed significantly more decreased pain level than the control group at 24 hr and 48 hr and more increased muscle activation than the cool-down group at 48 hr (p<.05). However, there were no significant differences in pain level and muscle activation between the only cool-down group and control group at all measurement sessions (p>.05). The findings suggest that the warm-up exercise performed before an intense exercise had beneficial effects on the symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness, whereas cool-down exercise performed after the intense exercise did not."

Recently, neurokinin-1 (NK1) antagonist has been used for PONV. We evaluated the effect of oral aprepitant premedication in addition to ondansetron.
Methods: A total 90 patients scheduled for elective rhinolaryngological surgery were allocated to three groups (Control, Ap80, Ap125), each of 30 at random. Ondansetron 4 mg was injected intravenously to all patients just before the end of surgery. On the morning of surgery, 80 mg and 125 mg aprepitant were additionally administered into the Ap80 group and Ap125 group, respectively. The rhodes index of nausea, vomiting and retching (RINVR) was checked at 6 hr and 24 hr after surgery.
Results: Twelve patients who used steroids unexpectedly were excluded. Finally 78 patients (control : Ap80 : Ap125 = 24 : 28 : 26) were enrolled. Overall PONV occurrence rate of Ap125 group (1/26, 3.9%) was lower (P = 0.015) than the control group (7/24, 29.2%) at 6 hr after surgery. The nausea distress score of Ap125 group (0.04 ± 0.20) was lower (P = 0.032) than the control group (0.67 ± 1.24) at 6 hr after surgery. No evident side effect of aprepitant was observed.
Conclusions: Oral aprepitant 125 mg can be used as combination therapy for the prevention of PONV."
948,Prognostic Value of Baseline 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT in Patients with Multiple Myeloma: A Multicenter Cohort Study,문승환 /Seung Hwan Moon,2018,대한영상의학회,"Objective: We investigated the prognostic value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).
Materials and Methods: Subjects were 76 patients with newly diagnosed myeloma and pretreatment with18F-FDG PET/CT from four hospitals. The PET/CT features were evaluated and the clinical characteristics were reviewed. Prognostic factors related to poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were identified using a Cox proportional hazards regression model and a prediction scale was developed based on the identified factors.
Results: Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of 18F-FDG-avid focal bone lesions (≥ 3) was a significant and independent predictor of PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.28, p = 0.007) and OS (HR = 11.78, p = 0.001). The presence of extramedullary disease on PET/CT scan was also a significant predictor of poor PFS (HR = 2.79, p = 0.006) and OS (HR = 3.89, p = 0.003). A prognostic scale was developed using these two predictors. An increase in score on the scale corresponded to a significantly increased risk of poor OS (p = 0.005). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patient survival varied significantly according to the scale (p < 0.001 for OS and p = 0.001 for PFS).
Conclusion: 18F-FDG-avid focal lesions and the presence of extramedullary disease on PET/CT scan are significantly associated with poor OS in MM patients. The scale developed according to these predictors represents a potential prognostic tool for evaluation of patients with MM."
949,Association of tumor differentiation grade and survival of women with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix,Koji Matsuo,2018,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: To examine the association between tumor grade and survival for women with squamous cervical cancer.
Methods: This retrospective observational study utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result program data between 1983 and 2013 to examine women with squamous cervical cancer with known tumor differentiation grade. Multivariable analyses were performed to assess independent associations between tumor differentiation grade and survival.
Results: A total of 31,536 women were identified including 15,175 (48.1%) with grade 3 tumors, 14,084 (44.7%) with grade 2 neoplasms and 2,277 (7.2%) with grade 1 tumors. Higher tumor grade was significantly associated with older age, higher stage disease, larger tumor size, and lymph node metastasis (all, p<0.001). In a multivariable analysis, grade 2 tumors (adjusted-hazard ratio [HR]=1.21; p<0.001) and grade 3 tumors (adjusted-HR=1.45; p<0.001) were independently associated with decreased cause-specific survival (CSS) compared to grade 1 tumors. Among the 7,429 women with stage II–III disease who received radiotherapy without surgical treatment, grade 3 tumors were independently associated with decreased CSS compared to grade 2 tumors (adjusted-HR=1.16; p<0.001). Among 4,045 women with node-negative stage I disease and tumor size ≤4 cm who underwent surgical treatment without radiotherapy, grade 2 tumors (adjusted-HR=2.54; p=0.028) and grade 3 tumors (adjusted-HR=4.48; p<0.001) were independently associated with decreased CSS compared to grade 1 tumors.
Conclusion: Our study suggests that tumor differentiation grade may be a prognostic factor in women with squamous cervical cancer, particularly in early-stage disease. Higher tumor grade was associated with poorer survival."
950,Early Life Body Size in Relation to First Intracerebral or Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,Line K. Gjærde,2019,대한뇌졸중학회,"Background and Purpose As risk of hemorrhagic stroke may have early life origins, we investigated associations of birth weight and childhood body mass index (BMI) with adult intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
Methods We included 240,234 Danish schoolchildren, born 1936 to 1989, with information on birth weight and measured weights and heights from 7 to 13 years. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between early life anthropometrics and ICH or SAH, identified through linkage with national registers.
Results During the study period, 1,947 individuals (39% women) experienced an ICH and 797 individuals (64% women) experienced a SAH. Per 500 g increase in birth weight, women had a 10% decreased risk of SAH (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.97) and men had a 10% decreased risk of ICH (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.95). Birth weight was not associated with risks of ICH in women or SAH in men. In men, a childhood BMI below average (BMI z-score <0) was associated with increased risks of ICH. The association was stronger at older childhood ages, and at 13 years a BMI z-score of –1 was associated with a HR of 1.17 (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.28), and a BMI z-score of –2 with a HR of 1.46 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.82) for ICH. Childhood BMI was not associated with risks of ICH in women or with risks of SAH in both sexes.
Conclusions Early life body size is associated with ICH and SAH, and the associations differ by sex."
951,Prognostic Effect of Guideline-Directed Therapy Is More Noticeable Early in the Course of Heart Failure,안민수 /Min-Soo Ahn,2019,대한의학회,"Background: There have been few studies to evaluate the prognostic implications of guideline-directed therapy according to the temporal course of heart failure. This study assessed the relationship between adherence to guideline-directed therapy at discharge and 60-day clinical outcomes in de novo acute heart failure (AHF) and acute decompensated chronic heart failure (ADCHF) separately.
Methods: Among 5,625 AHF patients who were recruited from a multicenter cohort registry of Korean Acute Heart Failure, 2,769 patients with reduced ejection fraction were analyzed.
Guideline-directed therapies were defined as the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor II blocker (ARB), β-blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.
Results: In de novo AHF, ACEI or ARB reduced re-hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34–0.95), mortality (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24–0.69) and composite endpoint (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36–0.77) rates. Beta-blockers reduced re- hospitalization (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41–0.95) and composite endpoint (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47–0.90) rates. In ADCHF, adherence to ACEI or ARB was associated with only mortality and β-blockers with composite endpoint.
Conclusion: The prognostic implications of adherence to guideline-directed therapy at discharge were more pronounced in de novo heart failure. We recommend that guideline- directed therapy be started as early as possible in the course of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction."

This study devised and validated a new hepatoma arterial-embolization prognostic (HAP) score optimized for use in patients undergoing treatment with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for recurrence subsequent to surgical resection of HCC. Methods: Training cohort (n=424) and validation cohort (n=350) patients with recurrent HCC after resection treated with TACE between 2003 and 2016 were enrolled. Cox regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analyses were used to identify risk factors for survival and to calculate the predictive performance of risk scores, respectively. Results: The median age of the study population was 59.2 years. α-Fetoprotein >400 ng/mL (hazard ratio [HR]=1.815), serum albumin ≤3.5 g/dL (HR=1.966), tumor number ≥2 (HR=1.425), tumor size >5 cm at resection or recurrence (HR=1.356), segmental portal vein invasion at resection or recurrence (HR=2.032), and time from resection to recurrence ≤1 years (HR=1.849) independently predicted survival (all p<0.05). The postoperative HAP (pHAP) model based on the rounded HRs of these variables showed an AUC of 0.723 for predicting survival at 3 years, which was significantly higher than AUCs of other HAP-based models, including HAP, modified HAP, and modified HAP-II scores (0.578-0.621) (all p<0.05). The accuracy of pHAP was maintained in the entire cohort (n=774; AUC=0.776 at 3 years). Conclusions: A new pHAP score optimized for patients treated with TACE due to recurrent HCC after resection showed acceptable accuracy and was externally validated. Further studies of means by which to select treatment options other than TACE for high-risk patients according to pHAP scores are warranted."

Adherence to the tooth surface by S. mutans is an important step in initiation of dental caries. This study was to examine antibacterial activity and anti-adhesive effect of Scutellaria baicalensis extract against S. mutans. Extracts of S. baicalensis were tested for antimicrobial activities by paper disc methods and radial diffusion assay methods, and bacterial adherence assay using 3 type of hydroxyapatite. The antibacterial level of ethyl acetate extract, IPK-3 on the growth of S. mutans was 125 ㎎/㎖ of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The maximum growth of S. mutans in medium added with IPK-3 extract (50 mg/ml) was delayed to 30 hr, while the highest at 24 hr in control medium. The pH values of the control medium was 5.63 at 18 hr, but the media supplemented with IPK-3 extract was pH 6.50 at 12 hr. In adhesive inhibition assay, S. mutans was labelled with the fluorescent indicator DAPI and measured with fluorescence microscope. Adhesion of S. mutans on hydroxyapatite beads was inhibited by IPK-3 extracts. These results suggest that S. baicalensis extract can be used as an effective material for antibacterial activity and adhesive inhibition against S. mutans.천연물 황금으로부터 여러 유기용매 추출물을 얻어 치

954,Risk Factors for Postoperative Recurrence in Korean Patients with Crohn’s Disease,Sung Bae Kim,2020,거트앤리버 소화기연관학회협의회,"Background/Aims: A considerable number of patients with Crohn’s disease still need intestinal resection surgery. Postoperative recurrence is an important issue in Crohn’s disease management, including the selection of high-risk patients. Eastern Asian patients showed several differences from Caucasian patients. Therefore, we investigated the postoperative surgical recurrence outcome and identified risk factors in Korean patients. Methods: Clinical data of 372 patients with Crohn’s disease who underwent first intestinal resection between January 2004 and August 2014 at 14 hospitals in Korea were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Over the follow-up period, 50 patients (17.1%) showed surgical recurrence. The cumulative surgical recurrence rate was 6.5% at 1 year and 15.4% at 7 years. Age under 16 (p=0.011; hazard ratio [HR], 5.136; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.576 to 16.731), colonic involvement (p=0.023; HR , 2.011; 95% CI, 1.102 to 3.670), and the presence of perianal disease at surgery (p=0.008; HR, 2.239; 95% CI, 1.236 to 4.059) were independent risk factors associated with surgical recurrence. Postoperative thiopurine treatment (p=0.002; HR, 0.393; 95% CI, 0.218 to 0.710) was a protective factor for surgical recurrence. Conclusions: Among the disease characteristics at surgery, younger age, colonic location, and perianal lesions were independent risk factors for surgical recurrence. Postoperative thiopurine treatment significantly reduced the incidence of surgical recurrence."
955,The effect of an Olympic distance triathlon on the respiratory muscle strength and endurance in triathletes,Alain Boussana,2020,한국운동재활학회,"High-intensity exercise, marathons, and long distances triathlons have been shown to induce the fatigue of respiratory muscles (RMs). Nevertheless, fatigue and the recovery period have not been studied in response of an Olympic distance triathlon (1.5-km swim, 40-km bike, 10-km run: short-distance triathlon). The aim of this study was to evaluate the RM fatigue induced by an Olympic distance triathlon. Nine male triathletes (24± 1.1 years) underwent spirometric testing and the assessment of RM performance. Respiratory function tests were conducted in sitting position. Spirometric parameters, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, and RM endurance assessed by measuring the time limit were evaluated before (pre-T), after (post-T), and the day following the triathlon (post-T-24 hr). Residual volume increased: pre-T vs. post-T (P< 0.002), maximal inspiratory pressure significantly decreased from 127.4± 17.2 (pre-T) to 121.6± 18.5 cmH2O (post-T) (P< 0.001) and returned to the pre-T value 24 hr after the race (125.0± 18.6). RM endurance significantly decreased from 4:51± 0:8 (pre-T) to 3:13± 0:7 min (post-T, P< 0.001) and then remained decreased for 24 hr after the race from 4:51± 0:8 (pre-T) to 3:39± 0:4 min 24 hr after (P< 0.002). Both, strength and endurance of inspiratory muscles decrease after Olympic distance triathlon. Furthermore, the impaired of inspiratory muscle endurance 24 hr after the race suggested a slow recovery and persistence of inspiratory muscle fatigue."
956,Interaction of Body Mass Index and Diabetes as Modifiers of Cardiovascular Mortality in a Cohort Study,마승현,2012,대한예방의학회,"Objectives: Diabetes and obesity each increases mortality, but recent papers have shown that lean Asian persons were at greater risk for mortality than were obese persons. The objective of this study is to determine whether an interaction exists between body mass index (BMI) and diabetes, which can modify the risk of death by cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Methods: Subjects who were over 20 years of age, and who had information regarding BMI, past history of diabetes, and fasting blood glucose levels (n=16 048), were selected from the Korea Multi-center Cancer Cohort study participants. By 2008, a total of 1290 participants had died; 251 and 155 had died of CVD and stroke, respectively. The hazard for deaths was calculated with hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) by Cox proportional hazard model.
Results: Compared with the normal population, patients with diabetes were at higher risk for CVD and stroke deaths (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.56; HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.76; respectively). Relative to subjects with no diabetes and normal BMI (21 to 22.9 kg/m2), lean subjects with diabetes (BMI <21 kg/m2) had a greater risk for CVD and stroke deaths (HR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.57 to 5.09; HR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.58 to 6.76; respectively), while obese subjects with diabetes (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) had no increased death risk (p-interaction <0.05). This pattern was consistent in sub-populations with no incidence of hypertension.
Conclusions: This study suggests that diabetes in lean people is more critical to CVD deaths than it is in obese people."

유입방식 변화에 따른 황 탈질조의 탈질효율 평가결과, 상향류 방식이 탈리된 미생물과 유출 고형물의 재침전으로 인하여 하향류 방식보다 유출 유기물 농도가 낮은 것으로 조사되었다. 또한, 상향류 방식에서 T-N 제거 효율은 73.3∼90.2%로 하향류 방식보다 약 10.0% 이상 높은 것으로 조사되어 질소제거 측면에서도 상향류 방식이 유리한 것으로 판단된다. EBCT 변화에 따른 질소제거 효율 검토결과, 1hr에서는 47.4%, 3hr에서는 88.1%, 5hr에서는 90.5%로 조사되어, 황 탈질 공정의 최적 EBCT는 3hr로 판단된다. 법 규정과 부하율에 따른 총질소 제거효율을 검토한 결과, T-N 법적 방류수질 20mg/L를 을 안정적으로 유지하기 위해서는 황 탈질조의 유입 T-N 부하율은 0.443kgT-N/㎥·day 이하로 유지하여야 한다.This study examined the influent of a sulfur denitrification reactor using nitrified effluent from a batch type reactor. The denitrification efficiency was compared according to the injection type. The nitrogen removal effects were compared with the changes in the EBCT and nitrogen concentration of the influent to determine the optimal operation conditions with the selected injection type.
A denitrification efficiency evaluation of a reactor according to the change in injection type and up-flow was performed using a lower organic concentration of the effluent than the down-flow because of the re-precipitation of desorbed microbes and spilled solids. In the up-flow type, organics were controlled by the low concentration than the down-flow type because of solid re-precipitation. The T-N removal efficiency of the up-flow type was 73.3~90.2%, which was more that 10% higher that down-flow type. This means that the up-flow type has a great advantage in removing T-N and organics. The T-N removal efficiency by EBCT at 1hr was 47.3%, and was 88.1% and 90.5% by EBCT 3hr and 5hr, respectively. Therefore, the optimal operation conditions to remove nitrogen was considered to be EBCT for 3hr. After careful consideration of rule of law and T-N removal effects, the T-N load factor in the reactor should remain below 0.443kgT-N/㎥·day to maintain the legal total nitrogen concentration for discharge, which is 20mg/L."
958,Clinical validation of the 2017 international consensus guidelines on intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas,Jae Seung Kang,2019,대한외과학회,"Purpose: The 2017 international consensus guidelines (ICG) for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas were recently released. Important changes included the addition of worrisome features such as elevated serum CA 19-9 and rapid cyst growth (>5 mm over 2 years). We aimed to clinically validate the 2017 ICG and compare the diagnostic performance between the 2017 and 2012 ICG. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. During January 2000–January 2017, patients who underwent complete surgical resection and had pathologic confirmation of branch-duct or mixed-type IPMN were included. To evaluate diagnostic performance, the areas under the receiver operating curves (AUCs) were evaluated. Results: A total of 448 patients were included. The presence of mural nodule (hazard ratio [HR], 9.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.60–18.09; P = 0.001), main pancreatic duct dilatation (>5 mm) (HR, 5.32; 95% CI, 2.67–10.60; P = 0.001), thickened cystic wall (HR, 3.40; 95% CI, 1.51–7.63; P = 0.003), and elevated CA 19-9 level (>37 unit/mL) (HR, 5.25; 95% CI, 2.05–13.42; P = 0.001) were significantly associated with malignant IPMN. Malignant lesions showed a cyst growth rate >5 mm over 2 years more frequently than benign lesions (60.9% vs . 29.7%, P = 0.012). The AUC was higher for the 2017 ICG than the 2012 ICG (0.784 vs . 0.746). Conclusion: The new 2017 ICG for IPMN is clinically valid, with a superior diagnostic performance to the 2012 ICG. The inclusion of elevated serum CA 19-9 level and cyst growth rate to the 2017 ICG is appropriate"
959,"Significant clinicopathologic prognostic factors for bladder recurrence, progression, and cancer-specific survival after surgery among patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma",김성한 /KIM Sung Han,2019,대한비뇨의학회,"Purpose: This study aimed to identify prognostic factors for outcomes after radical nephroureterectomy among patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).
Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 184 nonmetastatic cases of UTUC after radical nephroureterectomy, bladder cuffing, and/or partial cystectomy (2004–2016). Bladder recurrence-free survival (BRFS), disease progression-free survival (DPFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were estimated. The prognostic values of clinicopathologic parameters were evaluated by using Cox logistic regression analysis.
Results: The median BRFS, DPFS, and CSS values were 19.0 months, 38.5 months, and 67.0 months, respectively. We identified cases of bladder recurrence (64 cases, 34.8%), disease progression (54 cases, 29.3%), and cancer-specific death (23 cases, 12.5%). BRFS was independently associated with lymphovascular invasion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.421); DPFS was associated with intravesical instillation (HR, 0.290), active smoking (HR, 0.367), synchronous bladder lesions (HR, 2.355), and pT2 (HR, 5.199) and pT3 and pT4 (HR, 13.281) stages; and CSS was associated with alkaline phosphatase levels (HR, 0.966). Among 123 cases without previous bladder cancer, DPFS was associated with intravesical instillation (HR, 0.264), multifocal ureteral tumors (HR, 4.823), and pT3 and pT4 stages (HR, 10.899), whereas CSS was associated with pTis (HR, 32.071).
Conclusions: Patients with the factors we identified should receive adjuvant intravesical/systemic chemotherapy and intensive surveillance."

At first, rape stalk (RS)　was immersed in distilled water (DW), acetic acid (AA), oxalic acid (OA), sulfuric acid (SA) and sodium hydroxide (SH) solutions, and the content of reducing sugars liberated from immersed RS was analyzed.
Glucose, xylose, arabinose and sucrose were detected varying with the immersion type. In particular, 1% AA-immersion of RS for 72 hr was the most effective conditions to liberate glucose from RS. Secondly, the RS residues were used for elementary analysis and fabrication of fuel pellets. In addition to the solution type, concentration of immersion solutions (0%, 1%, 2%) and immersion time (24, 72, 120 hr) were used as experimental factors. The contents of nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine reduced effectively through the immersion of RS in DW, AA and OA solutions. For properties of RS-based pellets, bulk density and higher heating value of RS-based pellets greatly increased with the immersion of RS, and the qualities were much higher than those of the A-grade pellet of the EN standards. Ash content decreased remarkably through the immersion of RS, and was satisfied with the A-grade pellet standard. Durability was negatively affected by the immersion of RS, and did not reached to B-grade of the EN standard. In conclusion, acid immersion of RS can be a pretreatment method for the production of fuel pellet and bioethanol, but use of the immersed RS for the production of high-quality pellets might be restricted due to low durability of immersed-RS pellets. Therefore, further studies, such as investigation of detailed immersion conditions, fabrication of mixed pellets with wooden materials and addition of binders, are needed to resolve the problems."
962,Quantitative Determination of Organic Yield by Continuous Percolation Processes of Bio-wastes at K Composting Plant,서정윤 /SEO JEOUNG YOON,2014,대한환경공학회,"Percolation is the important process of extracting the soluble constituents of a fine mesh, porous substance by passage of a liquid through it. In this study, bio-wastes were percolated under various conditions through continuous percolation processes, and the energy potential of percolate was evaluated. The representative bio-wastes from the K composting plant in Darmstadt, Germany were used as the sample for percolation. The central objective of this study was to determine the optimal amount of process water and the optimum duration of percolation through the bio-wastes. For economic reasons, the retention time of the percolation medium should be as long as necessary and as short as possible. For the percolation of the bio-wastes, the optimal percolation time was 2 hr and maximum percolation time was 4 hr. After 2 hr, more than two-thirds of the organic substances from the input material were percolated. In the first percolation process, the highest yields of organic substance were achieved. The best percolation of the bio-wastes was achieved when the process water of 2 L for the first percolation procedure and then the process water of 1.5 L for each further percolation procedure for a total 8 L for all five procedures were used on 1,000 g fresh bio-waste. The gas formation potentials of 0.83 and 0.96 Nm3/ton fresh matter (FM) were obtained based on the percolate from 1 hr percolation of 1,000 g bio-waste with the process water of 2 L according to the measurement of the gas formation in 21 days (GB21). This method can potentially contribute to reducing fossil fuel consumption and thus combating climate change."

The study aims to determine the probability of survival in patients with CRC presence of low levels of schooling and a rural population, adjusted for clinical stage and type of treatment.Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in a cohort of 305 patients with CRC treated at State Cancer Center, located in Veracruz-Mexico; the follow-up period of 60 months (2012–2016). The survival probability was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the log-rank test with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Prognostic factors were determined using hazard ratio (HR) multivariate Cox regression analysis.Results: Overall survival was 40% at 60 months. Subjects in the age group ≥ 65 years had a low survival rate of 28% (<i>P</i>= 0.026) and an advanced clinical stage of 22% (<i>P</i>< 0.001). Of the patients with bone metastasis, none survived longer than 5 years (<i>P</i>= 0.008). With respect to the unfavorable prognostic factors identified in the multivariate analysis, a decreased level of schooling was associated with an HR of 7.6 (95% CI, 1.1–54.7), advanced clinical stage was associated with an HR of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.2–4.0), and the presence of metastasis had an HR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1–2.9).Conclusions: Poor prognostic factors include an advanced clinical stage, the presence of metastasis and a low level of schooling. These findings confirm the importance of screening for early diagnosis, diminishing the barriers to accessing treatment and prospectively monitoring the population."
964,Differential Expression of TGF-β Isoforms in Human Kerationocytes by Narrow Band UVB,정문철,2008,대한피부과학회,"Background: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a multifunctional growth factor, has
three isoforms: TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3. Different isoforms of TGF-β are associated
with different proliferation and differentiation states of the epidermis. Narrow band ultraviolet
B (NBUVB) emits a concentrated UVB source of 311 nm. NBUVB 1,000 mJ/cm2 induces
apoptosis in approximately 50% of keratinocytes.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether irradiation with NBUVB would
alter the expression and production of TGF-β1, 2, and 3.
Methods: We measured TGF-β1, 2, and 3 mRNA and TGF-β1 and 2 protein levels at
800, 1,000, and 1,200 mJ/cm2 for 24 hours and 48 hours.
Results: TGF-β1 mRNA levels were increased at both 24 hr and 48 hr, TGF-β2 mRNA
levels were decreased at both 24 hr and 48 hr, and TGF-β3 mRNA levels were increased at
24 hr and similar to control at 48 hr. TGF-β1 protein levels were increased at 48 hr but
decreased at 24 hr. TGF-β2 protein levels were decreased at both 24 hr and 48 hr.
Conclusion: The results suggest a possible role for TGF-β1 after NBUVB irradiation and
opposing roles for TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 isoforms in NBUVB irradiation.

966,Comparative Analysis of the Genomes of Bombyx mandarina and Bombyx mori Nucleopolyhedroviruses,Yi-Peng Xu,2010,한국미생물학회,"The Bombyx mandarina nucleopolyhedrovirus (BomaNPV) S1 strain can infect the silkworm, Bombyx mori,but is significantly less virulent than B. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) T3 strain. The complete nucleotide sequence of the S1 strain of BomaNPV was determined and compared with the BmNPV T3 strain.
The circular, double stranded DNA genome of the S1 strain was 126,770 nucleotides long (GenBank accession no. FJ882854), with a G+C content of 40.23%. The genome contained 133 potential ORFs. Most of the putative proteins were more than 96% identical to homologs in the BmNPV T3 strain, except for bro-a, lef-12,bro-c, and bro-d. Compared with the BmNPV T3 strain, however, this genome did not encode the bro-b and bro-e genes. In addition, hr1 lacked two repeat units, while hr2L, hr2R, hr3, hr4L, hr4R, and hr5 were similar to the corresponding hrs in the T3 strain. The sequence strongly suggested that BomaNPV and BmNPV are variants with each other, and supported the idea that baculovirus strain heterogeneity may often be caused by variation in the hrs and bro genes."

So, we investigated what is the ideal fluid which does not lead to hyperglycemia as well as hypoglycemia in fasted children.
Methods: Eighty ASA physical status I and II pediatric patients (1−7 years) were randomly divided into the four groups; Group I,II, III, and IV with twenty patients of each group. Patients in Group I, II, III, and IV received lactated Ringer’s solution, 1 : 2 : 3 SD solution, 1 : 2 SD solution, and 1 : 3 SD solution, respectively during the perioperative period. Blood glucose levels were checked at pre-induction, 1 hr after induction and 1 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr after end of operation. NPO time and total amounts of fluids administered were measured.
Results: There was no patient with preoperative hypoglycemia.
There were no significant differences in the perioperative blood glucose level among the groups. There was no relationship between blood glucose level and fasting time or age.
Conclusions: We conclude that all of the four fluids with different glucose concentrations in this study were appropriate to the fasted children."
968,α-Mangostin and Apigenin Induced Cell Cycle Arrest and Programmed Cell Death in SKOV-3 Ovarian Cancer Cells,Teeranai Ittiudomrak,2019,한국독성학회,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth main cause of pre-senescent death in women. Although chemotherapy is generally an efficient treatment, its side effects and the occurrence of chemotherapeutic resistance have prompted the need for alternative treatments. In this study, α-mangostin and apigenin were evaluated as possible anticancer alternatives to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin, used herein as a positive control. The ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line SKOV-3 (ATCC No. HTB77) was used as model ovarian cancer cells, whereas the skin fibroblast line CCD- 986Sk (ATCC No. CRL-1947) and lung fibroblast line WI-38 (ATCC No. CCL-75) were used as model untransformed cells. Apigenin and doxorubicin inhibited the growth of SKOV-3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
After 72 hr exposure, doxorubicin was mostly toxic to SKOV-3 cells, whereas apigenin was toxic to SKOV-3 cells but not CCD-986Sk and WI-38 cells. α-Mangostin was more toxic to SKOV-3 cells than to CCD-986Sk cells. A lower cell density, cell shrinkage, and more unattached (floating round) cells were observed in all treated SKOV-3 cells, but the greatest effects were observed with α-mangostin. With regard to programmed cell death, apigenin caused early apoptosis within 24 hr, whereas α-mangostin and doxorubicin caused late apoptosis and necrosis after 72 hr of exposure. Caspase-3 activity was significantly increased in α-mangostin-treated SKOV-3 cells after 12 hr of exposure, whereas only caspase-9 activity was significantly increased in apigenin-treated SKOV-3 cells at 24 hr. Both α-mangostin and apigenin arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, but after 24 and 48 hr, respectively. Significant upregulation of BCL2 (apoptosis-associated gene) and COX2 (inflammation-associated gene) transcripts was observed in apigenin- and α-mangostin-treated SKOV-3 cells, respectively. α-Mangostin and apigenin are therefore alternative options for SKOV-3 cell inhibition, with apigenin causing rapid early apoptosis related to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and α-mangostin likely being involved with inflammation."

970,"Increased Risk of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria in Patients With Autoimmune Thyroid Diseases: A Nationwide, Population-based Study",김윤섭 /Yoon Seob Kim,2017,대한천식알레르기학회,"There was no previous population-based study on the comparison of the risk of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) between autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) and age- and gender-matched controls. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of CSU after diagnosis of AITD using national registry data from Korea. The secondary objective was to evaluate other risk factors of CSU. Based on the disease code diagnoses in 2003-2005, we composed an AITD group (n=3,659) and an age- and gender-matched control group (n=18,295). Each patient was tracked for whether CSU occurs or not until 2013. After adjusting for demographic differences and comorbidities, patients with AITD had a significantly higher rate of CSU compared to the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-1.70; P<0.001). Among the AITD patients, the adjusted HR for CSU was higher in patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HR, 1.50) than in those with Grave’s disease (HR, 1.33), although the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.368). Analysis of CSU patients associated with AITD showed that female patients had a significantly higher risk of CSU compared to male ones (HR, 1.34; P=0.001) and that those with allergic rhinitis (HR, 1.51; P<0.001), atopic dermatitis (HR, 2.44; P<0.001), and asthma (HR, 1.50; P<0.001) had a significantly higher risk of CSU compared to patients without respective diseases. Our results demonstrated that AITD could be significantly associated with an increased risk of CSU."
971,Long-Term Aspirin Use and 5-Year Survival in Healthy Adults: A Population-Based Cohort Study in South Korea,오탁규 /Tak Kyu Oh,2020,연세대학교의과대학,"Purpose: We investigated whether long-term aspirin use is associated with 5-year all-cause mortality.
Materials and Methods: Participants were individuals aged ≥40 years who were registered in the 2010 sample cohort database ofthe National Health Insurance Service in South Korea. Aspirin users were divided into three groups: continuous users (2006–2010), previous users (2006–2009), and new users (2010). Individuals with a history of coronary artery disease and cerebrovasculardisease were excluded. Five-year all-cause mortality was defined as mortality due to any cause from January 1, 2011 to December31, 2015. Data were analyzed by multivariable Cox regression.
Results: In total, 424444 individuals were included. Five-year all-cause mortality was 9% lower in continuous aspirin users thanin unexposed individuals [hazard ratio (HR): 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86–0.97; p=0.003]. Five-year all-cause mortalityrates in the new aspirin users (HR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.90–1.11; p=0.995) and previous aspirin users (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.94–1.09;p=0.776) were not significantly different from that in unexposed individuals. In the 40–60-year age group, 5-year all-cause mortalityin the continuous aspirin users was 24% lower (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.64–0.90; p=0.002) than that in unexposed individuals. However,in the >60-year age group, there was no significant association between aspirin use and 5-year all-cause mortality (HR: 0.96,95% CI: 0.90–1.02; p=0.199).
Conclusion: Long-term aspirin use is associated with reduced 5-year all-cause mortality in healthy adults, especially those aged<60 years."
972,Primary platinum resistance and its prognostic impact in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer: an analysis of three prospective trials from the NOGGO study group,Fabian Trillsch,2021,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: Patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) have a high need forreliable prognostic markers. Since significance of primary platinum resistance (PPR) versussecondary platinum resistance (SPR) was identified for patients receiving anti-angiogenictherapy, it has not been confirmed for chemotherapy only.
Methods: PROC patients from 3 prospective trials of the NOGGO study group (TOWER,NOGGO-Treosulfan, and TRIAS) were included in this meta-analysis. Exploratory Cox andlogistic regression analyses were performed to correlate progression-free survival (PFS) andoverall survival (OS) with the timing when platinum resistance developed.
Results: Of 477 patients, 264 (55.3%) were classified as PPR, compared to 213 (44.7%) withSPR. For patients receiving chemotherapy only, SPR was associated with a significantlylonger median PFS of 3.9 compared to 3.1 months for PPR (hazard ratio [HR]=0.78; p=0.015).
SPR versus PPR was confirmed to be an independent prognostic factor for better PFS inmultivariate analysis (HR=0.74; p=0.029). Benefit from adding sorafenib to chemotherapywas mainly seen in PPR (HR=0.40; p<0.001) compared to SPR patients (HR=0.83; p=0.465).
Conclusions: Prognostic significance of SPR versus PPR could be elucidated for patientsreceiving chemotherapy only. In contrast to bevacizumab, the multi-kinase inhibitorsorafenib exhibits profound therapeutic efficacy in PPR patients indicating potential toovercome this negative prognostic impact.--"
973,Effect of the Interval from Calving to First Insemination and Days Open on the Subsequent Reproductive Performance in Dairy Cows,이수찬,2013,한국임상수의학회,"This retrospective study evaluated the effects of the interval from calving to first insemination (ICFI) and days open (DO) on the reproductive performance in dairy cows. In the first analysis, data from 705 cows were grouped based on the ICFI: short (30-60 days, n = 217), medium (61-90 days, n = 309), and long (91-150 days, n = 179). The occurrence of endometritis was greater in the long group than in short and medium groups (p < 0.05). The occurrence of ovarian cysts increased with increasing ICFI (p < 0.05), while body condition score (BCS) during the 5 month postpartum period was lower with increasing ICFI (p < 0.01). The hazard of pregnancy by 365 days in milk (DIM) was lower (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.70, p < 0.0001) in the long group, but higher (HR = 1.41, p < 0.0001) in the short group compared with the medium group. In the second analysis, data from 436 cows were grouped based on the DO: short (30-90 days, n = 154), medium (91-180 days, n = 183), and long (181-360 days, n = 99). The occurrence of a retained placenta was greater in the long group than in the medium group (p < 0.05). Ovarian cysts occurred more frequently in medium and long groups than in the short group (p = 0.08). BCS was lower in the short group compared with medium and long groups at month 1 postpartum (p < 0.05). Milk yield (kg/day) was greater in the medium group compared with the short group at months 2 to 5 postpartum (p < 0.05). The hazard of first insemination by 150 DIM was lower in the long group than in the short group (HR = 0.73; p < 0.02). The hazard of pregnancy by 365 DIM was lower (HR = 0.64, p < 0.0001) in the long group than in the medium group, while the hazard did not differ between short and medium groups (p > 0.05). Moreover, the culling rate was greater in the long group than in the short group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, a longer ICFI and DO resulted in reduced reproductive performance in dairy cows, which was attributable to an increase in postpartum diseases, a lower BCS and a greater milk yield.본 연구는 젖소에서 분만 후 첫 수정 간격 및 임신 간격이 이후의 번식능력에 미치는 영향에 대하여 조사하였다. 첫 번째 분석에서는, 705두의 젖소 자료를 첫 수정 간격에 따라 짧은 간격(30-60일, n = 217), 중간 간격(61-90 일, n = 309) 및 긴 간격(91-150일, n = 179) 군으로 구분하였다. 자궁내막염의 발생은 짧은 간격 및 중간 간격 군에 비해 긴 간격 군에서 증가되었다(p < 0.05). 첫 수정 간격이 증가함에 난소낭종의 발생은 증가한(p < 0.05) 반면, 분만 후5 개월 간의 BCS는 반대로 낮았다(p < 0.01). 분만 후 365일까지의 임신율은 중간 간격 군에 비하여 긴 간격 군에서는 낮았으나(hazard ratio[HR] = 0.70, p < 0.0001), 짧은 간격 군에서는 높았다(HR = 1.41, p < 0.0001). 두 번째 분석에서는, 436두의 젖소 자료를 임신 간격(공태 기간)에 따라 짧은 간격(30-90일, n = 154), 중간 간격(91-180일, n = 183) 및 긴 간격(181-360일, n = 99) 군으로 구분하였다. 후산정체 발생율은 중간 간격 군에 비해 긴 간격 군에서 높았으나(p < 0.05), 난소낭종의 발생은 짧은 간격 군에 비해 중간 간격 및 긴 간격 군에서 증가하는 경향이 있었다(p = 0.08). BCS는 분만 후 1개월에 중간 간격 및 긴 간격 군에 비해 짧은 간격 군에서 낮았다(p < 0.05). 산유량은 분만 후 2개월에서 5개월까지 짧은 간격 군에 비해 중간 간격 군에서 증가하였다(p < 0.05). 분만 후 150일까지 첫 수정율은 짧은간격 군에 비해 긴 간격 군이 낮았다(HR = 0.73, p < 0.02). 분만 후 365일까지의 임신율은 중간 간격 군에 비하여 긴간격 군에서는 낮았으나(HR = 0.64, p < 0.0001), 짧은 간격 군과 중간 간격 군에서는 차이가 없었다(p > 0.05). 더욱이, 도태율은 짧은 간격 군에 비해 긴 간격 군에서 증가하였다(p < 0.05). 결론적으로, 젖소에서 첫 수정 간격 및 임신 간격의 연장은 이후 번식능력의 감소를 초래하였으며, 이것은 산후 질병의 증가, BCS 감소 및 많은 산유량에 기인하였다.첫 수정 간격, 임신 간격, 젖소, 번식 능력."

975,Efficacy and Safety of Incontinence Surgery According to the Surgeon’s Specialty and Performance of a Preoperative Urodynamic Study,최진봉 /Jin Bong Choi,2018,대한배뇨장애요실금학회,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy and to estimate the complication rate of incontinence surgery according to the surgeon’s specialty and whether a preoperative urodynamic study (UDS) was performed, using a nationally representative dataset.
Methods: We enrolled 356,155 women over 20 years old who had undergone surgery for stress urinary incontinence between 2006 and 2015. Patients were followed for up to 3 years to analyze the reoperation and complication rates. Data were obtained from the National Health Claims Database of the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea. Multiple Cox regression analysis was conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of incontinence surgery according to the surgeon’s specialty and whether a preoperative UDS was performed.
Results: The hazard ratio (HR) for reoperation was significantly higher for procedures performed by nonurologists than for procedures performed by urologists (HR, 1.174; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.103–1.249). Acute urinary retention, postoperative infections, procedure-associated pain, and other complications were also more common in procedures performed by nonurologists than in those performed by urologists. When stratified by whether a preoperative UDS was performed, the HR for reoperation according to the surgeon’s specialty varied by performance of a preoperative UDS. While the reoperation rate was significantly higher in procedures performed by non-urologists when a preoperative UDS was performed (HR, 1.208; 95% CI, 1.122–1.3), there was no significant difference in the HRs for reoperation according to specialty when a preoperative UDS was not performed.
Conclusions: This population-based study showed that the postoperative outcomes of incontinence surgery were dependent upon the surgeon’s specialty and that the reoperation rate according to the surgeon’s specialty varied based on whether a preoperative UDS was performed."

Methods: Patients who underwent living donor SLT for recurrent HCC after LR from November 1996 to May 2017 were included. Patient demographic data, clinical and pathologic characteristics, operative data, hospital course, and follow-up data regarding initial LR, locoregional therapy after recurrence and SLT were reviewed. Prognostic factors for recurrence were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard ratio.
Results: Eighty-five of 123 SLT patients were included. Patients who had five or more locoregional therapies prior to SLT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45–9.64, P = 0.006), hepatitis B (HR, 9.20; 95% CI, 1.13–74.89; P = 0.04), outside Milan criteria at the time of SLT (HR, 2.66, 95% CI, 1.26–5.63; P = 0.011) and an alpha-fetoprotein level above 1,000 ng/mL at the time of recurrence after initial LR (HR, 6.48; 95% CI, 1.83–22.92; P = 0.004) and at the time of transplantation (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.26–5.63; P = 0.011) were related to significant risk of recurrence.
Conclusion: Continuing five or more locoregional therapies for recurrent HCC after LR is related to poor recurrence-free survival after SLT."
977,"Incidence, Diagnosis and Prognosis of Cardiac Amyloidosis",이민호,2013,대한심장학회,"Background and Objectives: Cardiac involvement is frequent in systemic amyloidosis and is the most important determinant of the clinical outcome. The aims of this study were to assess the incidence and prognosis of cardiac amyloidosis and discuss the diagnostic issues related to cardiac amyloidosis.
Subjects and Methods: We retrospectively studied all patients diagnosed with systemic amyloidosis who presented to our institution from January 1999 to December 2011.
Results: Of the 129 patients with systemic amyloidosis, cardiac amyloidosis was diagnosed in 62 patients. At the 3 years’ follow-up of the patients with systemic amyloidosis, there was a statistically significant difference in mortality between patients with cardiac amyloidosis and the rest of the patients (58.1% vs. 37.3%, p=0.008). In the Cox proportional hazard model, old age {hazard ratio (HR) 18.336, p=0.006}, elevation of cardiac troponin I (cTNI) (HR 13.246, p=0.020), left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (HR 5.137, p=0.041) and diastolic dysfunction (HR 64.595, p=0.022) were independently associated with survival in cardiac amyloidosis. In the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy, serum or urine protein electrophoresis was not sensitive enough to be used clinically compared to serum free light chain assay (35.8% vs. 96.4%).
Conclusion: In systemic amyloidosis, cardiac involvement was the most important determinant of the prognosis, and old age, elevation of cTNI, LV systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction were independently associated with survival in cardiac amyloidosis."
978,Sustained uremic toxin control improves renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with advanced renal dysfunction: post-hoc analysis of the Kremezin Study against renal disease progression in Korea,차란희 /Ran-hui Cha,2017,대한신장학회,"Background: We investigated the long-term effect of AST-120, which has been proposed as a therapeutic option against renal disease progression, in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Methods: We performed post-hoc analysis with a per-protocol group of the K-STAR study (Kremezin study against renal disease progression in Korea) that randomized participants into an AST-120 and a control arm. Patients in the AST-120 arm were given 6 g of AST-120 in three divided doses, and those in both arms received standard conventional treatment.
Results: The two arms did not differ significantly in the occurrence of composite primary outcomes (log-rank P = 0.41). For AST-120 patients with higher compliance, there were fewer composite primary outcomes: intermediate tertile hazard ratio (HR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.01, P = 0.05; highest tertile HR 0.436, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.76, P = 0.003. The estimated glomerular filtration rate level was more stable in the AST-120 arm, especially in diabetic patients. At one year, the AST-120-induced decrease in the serum indoxyl sulfate concentration inversely correlated with the occurrence of composite primary outcomes: second tertile HR 1.59, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.07, P = 0.17; third tertile HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.17, P = 0.031. Furthermore, AST-120 showed a protective effect against the major cardiovascular adverse events (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.99, P = 0.046).
Conclusion: Long-term use of AST-120 has potential for renal protection, especially in diabetic patients, as well as cardiovascular benefits. Reduction of the serum indoxyl sulfate level may be used to identify patients who would benefit from AST-120 administration."
979,Risk of Graft Failure in Kidney Recipients with Cured Post-Transplant Cancer,Ji Eun Kim,2020,대한의학회,"Background: Post-transplant cancer (PTC) is a critical complication after kidney transplantation. However, whether successfully cured PTC affects the long-term graft outcome remains unclear.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 1,629 kidney transplant recipients from 1995 to 2017 after excluding patients with post-transplant hematologic or advanced non-curable cancers and who underwent allograft nephrectomy because of cancer. Cured PTCs were defined as cancers treated with curative methods and/or adjuvant therapy without recurrence during ≥ 2 years. Propensity score matching was performed to match cured PTC patients with cancer- naïve patients (i.e., non-PTC group).
Results: During the median period of 7 years (maximum, 23 years), 70 patients (4.3%) had cured PTCs. The PTC group showed significantly higher risks of death-censored graft failure (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.56 [1.05–6.23]), class II donor-specific antibodies (adjusted HRs, 3.37 [1.30–8.71]), estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (adjusted HR, 2.68 [1.43–5.02]) and random urine protein/creatinine ratio > 1 g (adjusted HR, 3.61 [1.92–6.79]) compared to non-PTC group. However, the risk of mortality was not different between the PTC and non-PTC groups. According to the cancer type, only urogenital cancer had a significant association with graft failure (adjusted HR, 4.26 [1.19–15.22]) and the gastrointestinal cancer showed elevated risk of T cell mediated rejection compared to non- PTC (adjusted HR, 20.44 [6.02–69.39]).
Conclusion: Appropriate monitoring of graft function is necessary in patients with cured PTCs."
980,I-131 치료를 받은 분화갑상선암 환자에서 I-131의 유효반감기,박석건 /PARK Seokgun,2008,대한핵의학회,"Purpose: Effective half life of I-131 (Teff) in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer treated by I-131 is must-know value for dose calculation and determination of release time from isolation room. There has been no report about Teff in Koreans. Thus, author tried to measure dose rate without radiation exposure to faculty members and calculated Teff. Methods: Probe of radiation survey meter was fixed at the wall of isolation room, and body of survey meter was placed outside the room. With this simple arrangement, author could measure radiation frequently without radiation exposure to faculty members in 68 patient (F=55, M=13, age=47±13.7) treated by I-131 (3.7∼7.4 GBq) for differentiated thyroid cancer from Jan 2006 to Dec 2006. From this data, Teff, 48 hr retention rate, and the time necessary to whole body retention of I-131 become less than 1.1 GBq were calculated. Serum creatinine levels were measured before and after thyroid hormone withdrawal. Results: Teff was 15.4±4.3 hr (9.4∼32.5 hr). There was a loose correlation between Teff and serum creatinine concentration (r=0.45). 48hr retention was 4.9±4.2% (1∼23%). Time necessary to whole body retention of I-131 become less than 1.1 GBq was calculated as 47.1±13.2 hr for 9.25 GBq, 42.1±11.9 hr for 7.4 GBq, 35.7±10.0 hr for 5.55 GBq, and 26.7±7.5 hr for 3.7 GBq dose of I-131. Conclusion: Author successfully measured radiation dose rates in isolated patients treated by high dose of I-131 without radiation exposure to the faculty members with simple arrangement of survey meter probe. Using those data, Teff and some other indices were calculated.목적: I-131 치료를 받는 분화갑상선암 환자에서 I-131의 유효반감기(Teff)는 투여량의 계산이나 격리치료의 기간을 결정하기 위해서는 알아야 할 값 중 하나이다. 그러나 Teff를 계산하려면 자주 선량을 측정해야 하기 때문에 측정하는 사람의 방사선노출이 문제가 된다. 이런 이유로 아직 한국인에서 Teff 값은 찾기 어렵다. 측정하는 사람에 대한 방사선 노출 없이 연속적으로 선량 변화를 측정하고, 이로부터 Teff와 48시간 체내잔류량, 1.1 GBq 이하가 될 때까지의 시간을 계산하고자 하였다. 방법: 방사선 선량계의 탐침은 격리치료실 안의 벽에 고정하고, 선량계는 밖에서 읽도록 하는 간단한 방법을 사용하였다. 2006년 1월부터 12월까지 I-131 치료(3.7∼7.4 GBq)를 받은 분화갑상선환자 68명(여=55, 남=13, 연령=47±13.7)에서 격리치료실 입원 중 선량변화를 측정하였다. 이 값을 가지고 개인용 컴퓨터의 스프레드시트 프로그램을 사용하여 Teff를 계산하였다. 모든 환자에서 혈중 크레아티닌 농도를 측정하였다. 결과: Teff는 15.4±4.3 (9.4∼32.5)시간이었다. Teff는 혈중 크레아티닌이 증가할수록 길어지는 경향은 있었으나, 상관계수는 높지 않았다(r=0.45). 48시간 후 남은 양은 4.9±4.2 (1∼23)%였다. 전신에 남은 양이 1.1 GBq 이하가 될 때까지의 시간은, 9.25 GBq를 투여한다고 가정했을 때에는 47.1±13.2시간, 7.4 GBq일 때 42.1±11.9시간, 5.55 GBq일 때 35.7±10시간, 3.7 GBq일 때 26.7±7.5시간으로 계산되었다. 결론: 선량계의 탐침과 몸체를 분리하는 간단한 방법으로 측정하는 사람의 방사선노출이 없이 격리치료실에 입원한 환자의 선량변화를 연속적으로 측정할 수 있었고, 유도된 곡선으로부터 Teff를 계산했다. 이 값을 이용하여 48시간 체내잔류량과 투여한 양이 1.1 GBq 이하가 될 때까지의 시간을 계산하였다."
981,A Comparative Study of Rain Intensities Retrieved from Radar and Satellite Observations: Two Cases of Heavy Rainfall Events by Changma and Bolaven (TY15),이동인 /Lee， Dong-In,2012,한국지구과학회,"The heavy rainfalls caused large property damages and human casualties. For example, Changma caused 0.25 billion dollars in damages and 57 deaths and 112 missing by accompanying the torrentially convective heavy rainfall in Seoul, 2011. In addition, TY15 (Bolaven) caused a small damage by bringing a relatively small amount of rainfall and strong wind in Gwanju, 2012. The investigation and analyses of these mesoscale processes of rainfall events for different physical properties using KLAPS for weather environments of the above cases were performed. These typical and ideal meoscale systems by better and more favorable cloud systems were chosen to retrieve rain intensity from Radar and Chullian data. The quantitative rain intensities of Radar and Chullian differ greatly from the ground-based gauge values with underestimating over 50 mm/hr at the peak time of hourly maximum rain intensity about over than 85 mm/hr. However, the Radar rain intensity demonstrated approximately lower than 35 mm/hr, and the Chullian rain intensity less than 60 mm/hr for Changma in Seoul, 2011. For typhoon (TY15, Bolaven) in Gwangju, similarly, the quantitative rain intensities of Radar and Chullian differ from the ground-based gauge values. At the peak time, the hourly maximum rain intensity of ground-based gauge was more than 15 mm/hr. However, the Radar rain intensity showed lower than 5 mm/hr, and the Chullian rain intensity lower than 10 mm/hr. Regarding the above two cases of typhoon and Changma, even though Radar and Chullian rain intensities have been underestimated when compared to the ground-based rain intensity, the distributions of time scale features of both Radar and Chullian rain intensities still delineated a similar tendency of rain intensity distribution of the ground-based gauge data.2011년 7월 26일 서울은 장마에 동반된 기록적인 대류성 집중호우로 인해 약 2천5백억 원 이상의 재산피해와 57명(사망자)의 인명손실이 발생되었고, 2012년 8월 27일 15호 태풍 볼라벤에 동반된 집중호우로 광주광역시에는 보다 약한 집중호우와 강풍을 동반하여 피해는 상대적으로 적게 발생시켰다. 위의 사례에 대해 KLAPS(기상청 국지분석 및 예측시스템)을 사용하여 집중호우 시 다른 물리적 요소들에 의한 중규모 과정들의 조사 및 분석을 수행하였다. 이것은 레이더관측과 천리안 위성관측 자료로부터 강우강도를 도출하는데 호조건의 전형적인 중규모 시스템이기 때문에 선택되었으며, 두 사례는 모두 집중호우 발생에 좋은 환경임을 보였다. 2011년 장마에 동반되어 서울에 나타난 사례에서 레이더와 천리안의 정량적인 강우강도를 지상강우계 관측과 비교했을 때, 최대 관측값이 85 mm/hr 이상이 나타난 시점에 비해 약 50 mm/hr 이상이 과소 추정되는 차이가 나타났으나, 레이더 강우강도는 35 mm/hr의 차이와 천리안 강우강도는 60 mm/hr의 차이를 보였다. 그러나 2012년 8월 27일 15호 태풍 볼라벤에 동반되어 광주광역시에 나타난 강우강도와 지상강우강도의 경향은 위의 사례와 유사하게 나타났으며, 정량적인 강우강도 차이는 최대 관측값이 17 mm/hr 이상이 나타난 시점에 비해 약 10 mm/hr 이상이 과소 추정되는 차이가 나타났으나, 레이더 강우강도는 5 mm/hr의 차이와 천리안 강우강도는 10 mm/hr의 차이를 보였다. 이것은 태풍 볼라벤에 의한 집중호우가 상대적으로 약했기 때문이었다. 두 사례에 대해 레이더 강우강도와 천리안 강우강도는 지상강우강도와 시계열적으로 비교했을 때, 모두 유사한 경향을 보였다.강우강도, 천리안 위성, 중규모, 정량적 강우강도"
982,Change in Red Cell Distribution Width as Predictor of Death and Neurologic Outcome in Patients Treated with Therapeutic Hypothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest,김성탁 /Seongtak Kim,2014,대한중환자의학회,"Background: The prognostic significance of change in red cell distribution width (RDW) during hospital stays in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) was investigated.
Methods: Patients treated with TH after OHCA between January 2009 and August 2013 were reviewed. Patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were assessed according to Utstein Style. Hematologic variables including RDW, hematocrit, white blood cell count, and platelets were also obtained. RDW changes during the 72 hours after ROSC were categorized into five groups as follows: Group 1 (-0.8-0.1%), Group 2 (0.2-0.3%), Group 3 (0.4-0.5%), Group 4 (0.6-0.8%), and Group 5 (>0.8%).
Results: A total of 218 patients were enrolled in the study. RDW changes during the 72 hours after ROSC in Group 4 (HR 3.56, 95% CI 1.25-10.20) and Group 5 (HR 5.07, 95% CI 1.73-14.89) were associated with a statistically significant difference in one-month mortality. RDW changes were associated with statistically significant differences in neurologic outcome at 6 months after ROSC (Group 3 [HR 2.45, 95% CI 1.17-5.14], Group 4 [HR 2.79, 95% CI 1.33-5.84], Group 5 [HR 3.50, 95% CI 1.35-7.41]). Other significant variables were location of arrest, cause of arrest, serum albumin, and advanced cardiac life support time.
Conclusions: RDW change during the 72 hours after ROSC is a predictor of mortality and neurologic outcome in patients treated with TH after OHCA."
983,Incidence and Risk Factors of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism after Pulmonary Embolism,황헌규 /Hwang Hun Gyu,2019,대한결핵및호흡기학회,"Background: Information about the epidemiology of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence in Korea is lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate VTE cumulative recurrence rates and identify risk factors for VTE recurrence among Korean adults.
Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to a university teaching hospital for pulmonary embolism (PE) from 2005 to 2013. The main outcome of interest was a recurrence of VTE. We used Cox proportional hazard regression analyses to calculate the relative risk of VTE recurrence.
Results: Five-year cumulative incidence of recurrent VTE events was 21.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.7–25.4) in all cases of PE; 17% after provoked and 27% after unprovoked PE. Multivariate analysis showed that body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.02; 95% CI, 1.17–3.46; p=0.01) and longer anticoagulation therapy duration (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.96; p<0.01) were independently associated with risk of VTE recurrence. Risk factors not found to be statistically significant at the <0.05 level included history of VTE (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.84–3.88; p=0.12), unprovoked PE (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.89–3.25; p=0.10), symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.89–2.94; p=0.10), and female sex (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.78–2.55; p=0.24). We found that age, history of cancer, and other co-morbidities did not significantly affect the risk of VTE recurrence.
Conclusion: Recurrence of VTE after PE is high. Patients with BMI ≥25 or reduced anticoagulation therapy duration have a higher risk of recurrent VTE."
984,The Influence of Reconstruction Algorithm and Heart Rate on Coronary Artery Image Quality and Stenosis Detection at 64-Detector Cardiac CT,Yi-Ting Wang,2009,대한영상의학회,"Objective: We wanted to evaluate the impact of two reconstruction algorithms (halfscan and multisector) on the image quality and the accuracy of measuring the severity of coronary stenoses by using a pulsating cardiac phantom with different heart rates (HRs).
Materials and Methods: Simulated coronary arteries with different stenotic severities (25, 50, 75%) and different luminal diameters (3, 4, 5 mm) were scanned with a fixed pitch of 0.16 and a 0.35 second gantry rotation time on a 64-slice multidetector CT. Both reconstruction algorithms (halfscan and multisector) were applied to HRs of 40-120 beats per minute (bpm) at 10 bpm intervals. Three experienced radiologists visually assessed the image quality and they manually measured the stenotic severity.
Results: Fewer measurement errors occurred with multisector reconstruction (p = 0.05), a slower HR (p < 0.001) and a larger luminal diameter (p = 0.014); measurement errors were not related with the observers or the stenotic severity. There was no significant difference in measurements as for the reconstruction algorithms below an HR of 70 bpm. More nonassessable segments were visualized with halfscan reconstruction (p = 0.004) and higher HRs (p < 0.001). Halfscan reconstruction had better quality scores when the HR was below 60 bpm, while multisector reconstruction had better quality scores when the HR was above 90 bpm. For the HRs between 60 and 90 bpm, both reconstruction modes had similar quality scores. With excluding the nonassessable segments, both reconstruction algorithms achieved a similar mean measured stenotic severity and similar standard deviations.
Conclusion: At a higher HR (above 90 bpm), multisector reconstruction had better temporal resolution, fewer nonassessable segments, better quality scores and better accuracy of measuring the stenotic severity in this phantom study.Objective: We wanted to evaluate the impact of two reconstruction algorithms (halfscan and multisector) on the image quality and the accuracy of measuring the severity of coronary stenoses by using a pulsating cardiac phantom with different heart rates (HRs).

Methods: Eight patients (ASA I−II, 20−65 yr) undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to receive propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia or desflurane-remifentanil. The BIS was monitored and maintained between 45−55. At the end of surgery all anesthetics were discontinued. Time to eye opening and time to extubation was recorded. Subsequently, the patients were transported to the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) and the modified aldrete score, visual analogue scale (VAS), blood pressure,heart rate, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were recorded upon arrival at the PACU, as well as at 15 min, 30 min,1 hr, 2 hr, and 24 hr.
Results: There were no significant differences in the incidence of PONV between the two groups. Modified aldrete scores were significantly higher in the propofol group at 15 min postoperative period (P = 0.013, Propofol = 9.87, Desflurane = 9.62). Further,VAS scores were significantly higher in the desflurane group at 30min (P = 0.037, Propofol = 4.26, Desflurane = 5.0), and the number of antiemetic injections were significantly higher in the desflurane group at arrival to the PACU (P = 0.035, Propofol = 0, Desflurane = 0.11 ± 0.052) and at 24 hr (P = 0.03, Propofol = 0.41 ± 0.562,Desfluarane = 0.62 ± 0.157).
Conclusions: In patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with BIS monitoring, there is no significant differences in the incidence of PONV. The use of propofol is associated with less postoperative pain."
986,Mid-term Outcomes of Total Arterial Revascularization Versus Conventional Coronary Surgery in Isolated Three-Vessel Coronary Disease,정진우,2012,대한의학회,"Whether arterial conduits are superior to venous grafts in coronary artery bypassing has been debated. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes after total arterial revascularization versus conventional coronary bypassing using both arterial and venous conduits in isolated three-vessel coronary disease. Between 2003 and 2005, 503 patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting for three-vessel coronary disease were enrolled. A total of 117 patients underwent total arterial revascularization (Artery group) whereas 386 patients were treated with arterial and venous conduits (Vein group).
Major adverse outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, stroke and repeat revascularization)were compared. Clinical follow-up was complete in all patients with a mean duration of 6.1 ± 0.9 yr. After adjustment for differences in baseline risk factors, risks of death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-1.82, P = 0.90), myocardial infarction (HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.02-2.63, P = 0.22), stroke (HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.35-4.72, P = 0.70),repeat revascularization (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.26-1.55, P = 0.32) and the composite outcomes (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50-1.36, P = 0.45) were similar between two groups. Since the use of veins does not increase the risks of adverse outcomes compared with total arterial revascularization, a selection of the conduit should be more liberal."

988,Disease Progression in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients under Long-Term Antiviral Therapy,문진창,2015,거트앤리버 소화기연관학회협의회,"Background/Aims: We investigated factors associated with the disease progression and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients during long-term oral nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy. Methods: This retrospective study included 524 naive CHB patients who received oral NA therapy for more than 48 weeks between January 2003 and December 2007. The primary outcome was 5-year cumulative probability of disease progression and HCC development. Disease progression was defined as cirrhosis development, cirrhotic complications, HCC or liver-related mortality. Results: For the 524 patients, the cumulative probabilities of disease progression and HCC development at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years were 1.1%, 6.3%, 9.0%, 11.6%, and 16.2% and 0.2%, 1.8%, 3.6%, 5.8%, and 9.3%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, age >50 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05) and cirrhosis (HR, 2.95) were significant factors for disease progression. Similarly, age >50 years (HR, 1.05), family history of HCC (HR, 5.48), and cirrhosis (HR, 17.16) were significant factors for HCC development. Importantly, longer duration (>12 months) of maintained virological response (<20 IU/mL) reduced the risks of disease progression (HR, 0.19) and HCC development (HR, 0.09). Conclusions: Longer duration of maintained virological response significantly reduces the risk of disease progression or HCC development in CHB patients undergoing long-term oral NA therapy."
989,"경쟁우위, 인사관리제도, 기업성과: 인사관리제도의 진보성과 제도화",권기욱 /KIWOOK KWON,2017,한국생산성학회,"Organizational theories help better understand how organizations behave in order to achieve their goals assuming different boundary conditions: organizational goals, rationality in human choice behavior, influence of organizational environments, etc. However, we observe that a majority of organizational theories have increasingly emphasized the influence of environmental uncertainties on organizational choice decisions and activities. In this paradigm, interestingly, we can find that different theories explain the same organizational phenomena in various ways with their unique assumptions. These diverse interpretations, on the one hand, may facilitate the accumulation of knowledge to better understand an organizational phenomenon while, on the other hand, they may lead students to face ambiguities in interpreting said phenomenon.
This diversity in interpretations is frequently captured in organizational practices literatures. In particular, studies about the impact of human resource (HR) practices on firm performance in strategic human resource management (SHRM) literatures are a good example. A research question in this study is to examine why this phenomenon is prevalent in this field. In order to answer this question, this study seeks to identify the main theoretical arguments and review previous empirical findings on this topic. Then, this study proposes an integrative framework that may more accurately explain the impact of HR practices on firm performance, reconciling conflicting theoretical perspectives. This study argues that while investigating the relationship between HR practices and firm performance, researchers need to consider not only the adoption of HR practices based on rational models but also the institutionalization of HR practices in organizations. After developing a theoretical framework and research hypotheses predicting the effects of progressiveness and institutionalization of HR practices on performance, this study tests the hypotheses using a sample of Korean firms and shows the positive relationship between progressiveness and institutionalization of HR practices and firm performance as well as interaction effects of these two variables on firm performance."
990,Risk Scoring System to Assess Outcomes in Patients Treated with Contemporary Guideline-Adherent Optimal Therapies after Acute Myocardial Infarction,송필상 /Pil Sang Song,2018,대한심장학회,"Background and Objectives

A risk prediction is needed even in the contemporary era of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We sought to develop a risk scoring specific for patients with AMI being treated with guideline-adherent optimal therapies, including percutaneous coronary intervention and all 5 medications (aspirin, thienopyridine, β-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and statin).


Methods

From registries, 12,174 AMI patients were evaluated. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause death or AMI. The Korea Working Group in Myocardial Infarction (KorMI) system was compared with the Assessment of Pexelizumab in Acute Myocardial Infarction (APEX AMI), Controlled Abciximab and Device Investigation to Lower Late Angioplasty Complications (CADILLAC), and Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events scores (GRACE) models.


Results

Ten predictors were identified: left ventricular dysfunction (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3), bare-metal stent (HR, 2.0), Killip class ≥II (HR, 1.9), renal insufficiency (HR, 1.8), previous stroke (HR, 1.6), regional wall-motion- score >20 on echocardiography (HR, 1.5), body mass index ≤24 kg/m2 (HR, 1.4), age ≥70 years (HR, 1.4), prior coronary heart disease (HR, 1.4), and diabetes (HR, 1.4). Compared with the previous models, the KorMI system had good discrimination (time-dependent C statistic, 0.759) and showed reasonable goodness-of-fit by Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p=0.84). Moreover, the continuous-net reclassification improvement varied from −27.3% to −19.1%, the integrated discrimination index varied from −2.1% to −0.9%, and the median improvement in risk score was from −1.0% to −0.4%.


Conclusions

The KorMI system would be a useful tool for predicting outcomes in survivors treated with guideline-adherent optimal therapies after AMI."
991,Survival in clinical stage I endometrial cancer with single vs. multiple positive pelvic nodes: results of a multi-institutional Italian study,Stefano Uccella,2018,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: To investigate survival outcomes in endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) patients with single vs. multiple positive pelvic lymph nodes.
Methods: We performed a retrospective evaluation of all consecutive patients with histologically proven International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIC1 EEC who underwent primary surgical treatment between 2004 and 2014 at seven Italian gynecologic oncology referral centers. Patients with pre- or intra-operative evidence of extra-uterine disease (including the presence of bulky nodes) and patients with stage IIIC2 disease were excluded, in order to obtain a homogeneous population.
Results: Overall 140 patients met the inclusion criteria. The presence of >1 metastatic pelvic node was significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrence and mortality, compared to only 1 metastatic node, at both univariate (recurrence: hazard ratio [HR]=2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.2–3.99; p=0.01; mortality: HR=2.8; 95% CI=1.24–6.29; p=0.01) and multivariable analysis (recurrence: HR=1.91; 95% CI=1.02–3.56; p=0.04; mortality: HR=2.62; 95% CI=1.13–6.05; p=0.02) and it was the only independent predictor of prognosis in this subset of patients. Disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were significantly longer in patients with only 1 metastatic node compared to those with more than 1 metastatic node (p=0.008 and 0.009, respectively).
Conclusion: The presence of multiple metastatic nodes in stage IIIC1 EEC represents an independent predictor of worse survival, compared to only one positive node. Our data suggest that EEC patients may be categorized according to the number of positive nodes."
992,Association Between Plaque Thickness of the Thoracic Aorta and Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation After Ablation,황희정,2011,대한심장학회,"Background and Objectives: Several predictors of recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after ablation have been identified, including age, type of AF, hypertension, left atrial diameter and impaired left ventricular ejection fraction. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the atherosclerotic plaque thickness of the thoracic aorta is associated with a recurrence of AF after circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA). Subjects and Methods: Among patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal or persistent AF, 105 consecutive (mean age 58±11 years, male : female=76 : 29) patients who underwent transesophageal echocardiography and CPVA were studied. The relationships between the recurrence of AF and variables, including clinical characteristics, plaque thickness of the thoracic aorta, laboratory findings and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated. Results: A univariate analysis showed that the presence of diabetes {hazard ratio (HR)=3.425; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.422-8.249, p=0.006}, ischemic heart disease (HR=4.549; 95% CI, 1.679-12.322, p=0.003), duration of AF (HR=1.010; 95% CI, 1.001-1.018, p=0.025), type of AF (HR=2.412, 95% CI=1.042-5.584, p=0.040) and aortic plaque thickness with ≥4 mm (HR=9.514; 95% CI, 3.419-26.105, p<0.001) were significantly associated with the recurrence of AF after ablation. In Cox multivariate regression analysis, only the aortic plaque thickness (with ≥4 mm) was an independent predictor of recurrence of AF after ablation (HR=7.250, 95% CI=1.906-27.580, p=0.004). Conclusion: Significantly increased aortic plaque thickness can be a predictable marker of recurrence of AF after CPVA."
993,Atmosphere-forest Exchange of Ammoniacal Nitrogen in a Subalpine Deciduous Forest in Central Japan during a Summer Week,Kentaro Hayashi,2011,한국대기환경학회,"The present study aimed to investigate the diurnal variations in air concentrations and exchange fluxes of ammoniacal nitrogen (NHx: ammonia (NH_3) and particulate ammonium) in a subalpine deciduous forest in central Japan during a week in summer.
The NH_3 concentrations (0.50 μg N m^-3 on average)showed a clear circadian variation, i.e., high and low in the daytime and nighttime, respectively. The concentration of particulate ammonium in the coarse fractions was extremely low, whereas that for the PM2.5 fraction was relatively high (0.55 μg N m^-3 on average). The main inorganic ion components of PM2.5 at the study site were ammonium and sulfate.
The exchange fluxes of NHx were bidirectional. Both the maximum and minimum values occurred in the daytime, i.e., 0.39 mg N m^-2 hr^-1 of downward flux and 0.11 mg N m^-2 hr^-1 of upward flux for NH_3 and 0.25 mg N m^-2 hr^-1 of downward flux and 0.13 mg N m^-2 hr^-1 of upward flux for PM2.5 ammonium. The exchange fluxes of NHx at night could be considered as zero. The mean deposition velocity during the research period was almost zero for both NH_3 and PM2.5 ammonium. The atmosphere-forest exchange of NHx in the forest during the study period was balanced.
The remarkably large deposition of NHx was attributable to meteorological events such as showers the night before that thoroughly washed the forest canopy and subsequent clear skies in the morning,which enhanced convection. The cleaning effect of rainfall and the rapid change in convection in the early morning should be monitored to evaluate and generalize the gas and particle exchange in a forest."

DCG의 적합한 가동시간 선정하기위해 DCG 가동시간을 각각 12 hr, 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr별로 가동하였으며, 36 hr 가동시 수온약층이 형성되지 않았다. 또한,전력소모량을 산정하였을 때, 36 hr 가동후 2일간 정지하여 3일째 재가동하는 것이 효과적이라고 판단되었다. 위의 조건에서DCG 가동시 DO, 수온의 분석결과, 기존에 뚜렷하게 나타난 성층현상이 약하게 나타났으며, COD, chlorophyll-a의 수질분석결과, 가동 전보다 비교적 낮은 수치를 나타내어, DCG 가동으로 인한 밀도류 발생에 의한 물의 순환으로 수체가 안정적인조건으로 유지되고 있다고 판단된다.The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of applying density current generator (hereafter referred to as DCGto large lakes on the operating conditions of DCG, de-stratification, water quality improvement and inhibition of algae occurrence.
As a result of a survey conducted to derive the optimum operating parameters of DCG in a condition to minimize eco-toxicity,the following conclusions were obtained. During the survey period, a marked stratification appeared in September to October 2011and May 2012. At this time, the average depth of water to form thermocline was found to be 5 ± 2 m, so the location of dischargeport for the operation of DCG was determined to be about 5 m below from the surface. To minimize the adverse effects ofbenthos and obtain the effect of water mixture at the time of water circulation, the mixing ratio of surface water and deep waterwas designed to be 3:1 by means of ecotoxicological assessment on the DCG operating characteristics. To select the appropriateoperating hours for DCG, DCG was operated by 12 hr, 24 hr, 36 hr and 48 hr. As its result, the formation of thermocline didnot occur during the operation of 36 hr. Also, It was effected that start reoperating from 3rd day after stop 2days under the conditionof operated during 36 hr with calculated power consumption. Under the above conditions, the results of DO and watertemperature analysis during the operation of DCG showed that the stratification, which was distinct previously, appeared to beweak, and relatively lower levels than those before operation were found as a result of water quality analysis on COD andchlorophyll-a, which leads to the conclusion that the water body is maintained at a stable condition due to the circulation of waterby the occurrence of density current resulting from the operation of DCG.Density Current Generator (DCG), Stratification, Thermocline, Reoperating, Power Consumption"

We investigated the clinical outcomes and predictors of in-hospitalmortality after PCPS in patients with AMI complicated by severe refractory cardiogenicshock. Materials and Methods: From January 2004 to December 2011, we analyzed data from 96 consecutive AMI patients with cardiogenic shock assisted by a PCPS system. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The predictors of in-hospital mortality were determined by a Cox proportional-hazards model. Results:In-hospital mortality occurred in 51 (53.1%) patients and 58 (60.4%) patients were able to be weaned from PCPS. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performedin 61 (63.5%) patients before PCPS initiation. On multivariate analysis, age ≥67 years [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 4.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.27--9.93; p<0.001], CPR (adjusted HR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.11--4.85; p=0.03), lactate clearancefor 48 hours <70% (adjusted HR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.04--6.05; p=0.041), and unsuccessfulrevascularization (adjusted HR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.85--6.90; p=0.002) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality after PCPS in patients with AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock. Conclusion: In spite of PCPS management, AMI patients complicated by severe refractory cardiogenic shock demonstrated high mortality. Older age, CPR, lower lactate clearance for 48 hours, and unsuccessful revascularizationwere independent predictors of in-hospital mortality."
996,Association between Alzheimer’s Disease and Cancer Risk in South Korea: an 11-year Nationwide Population-Based Study,Ji Eun Lee,2018,대한치매학회,"Background and Purpose: Previous studies have suggested a decreased cancer risk among patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). There remains a lack of data on the specific types of cancer and risk factors for developing cancer in AD. We evaluated the association between AD and cancer risk, and we examined specific types of cancer.
Methods: A population-based longitudinal study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Service-Senior cohort for 2002–2013. A total of 4,408 AD patients were included in the study, as were 19,150 matched controls. Potential associations between the risk of cancer and AD were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regressions.
Results: Cancer developed in 12.3% of the AD group patients and in 18.5% of control group subjects. AD was associated with a reduced risk of cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% confidence intervals, 0.64–0.78). The risk of head and neck cancers was significantly reduced (HR, 0.49), as were risks for cancers of the digestive tract, including stomach cancer (HR, 0.42), colorectal cancer (HR, 0.61), liver and biliary tract cancers (HR, 0.68), and pancreatic cancer (HR, 0.55). Lung and prostate cancer risks were also significantly lower for the AD group (HR, 0.52 and HR, 0.72, respectively).
Conclusions: Our results showed an inverse association between AD and cancer. Further research involving a large number of patients in a hospital based-study is needed to address the biological associations between cancer development and dementia, including AD."
997,Prescription Refill Gap of Endocrine Treatment from Electronic Medical Records as a Prognostic Factor in Breast Cancer Patients,이유라 /Yura Lee,2019,한국유방암학회,"Purpose: Discontinuation of hormone therapy is known to lead to a poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. We aimed to investigate the prescription gap as a prompt index of medication adherence by using prescription data extracted from patient electronic medical records.
Methods: A total of 5,928 patients diagnosed with invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer, who underwent surgery from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2009, were enrolled retrospectively. The prescription data for 4.5 years of hormonal treatment and breast cancer-related events after treatment completion were analyzed. We examined the characteristics and prognoses of breast cancer in patients with and without a 4-week gap.
Results: Patients with a gap showed a significantly higher risk of breast cancer recurrence, distant metastasis, breast cancer-specific death, and overall death after adjustment (hazard ratio [HR], 1.389; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.089–1.772; HR, 1.568; 95% CI, 1.158–2.123; HR, 2.108; 95% CI, 1.298–3.423; and HR, 2.102; 95% CI, 1.456–3.034, respectively). When patients were categorized based on gap summation, the lower third (160 days) and fourth (391 days) quartiles showed a significantly higher risk of distant metastasis (HR, 1.758; 95% CI, 1.186–2.606 and HR, 1.844; 95% CI, 1.262–2.693, respectively).
Conclusion: A gap of > 4 weeks in hormonal treatment has negative effects on breast cancer prognosis, and can hence be used as a sentinel index of higher risk due to treatment non-adherence. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether the gap can be used as a universal index for monitoring the adherence to hormonal treatment."

Materials and Methods: Data were collected and analyzed for 2412 NMIBC patients from 15 centers who were initially diagnosed after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) from January 2006 to December 2010. Using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, the prognostic value of each variable was evaluated for the time to first recurrence and progression.
Results: With a median follow-up duration of 37 months, 866 patients (35.9%) experienced recurrence, and 137 (5.7%) experiencedprogression. Patients with recurrence had a median time to the first recurrence of 10 months. Multivariable analysis conductedin all patients revealed that preoperative positive urine cytology (PUC) was independently associated with worse recurrence-free survival [RFS; hazard ratio (HR) 1.56; p<0.001], and progression-free survival (PFS; HR 1.56; p=0.037). In particular, on multivariable analysis conducted for the high-risk group (T1 tumor/high-grade Ta tumor/carcinoma in situ), preoperative PUC was an independent predictor of worse RFS (HR 1.73; p<0.001) and PFS (HR 1.96; p=0.006). On multivariable analysis in patients with T1 high-grade (T1HG) cancer (n=684), better RFS (HR 0.75; p=0.033) and PFS (HR 0.33; p<0.001) were observed in associationwith the administration of intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induction therapy.
Conclusion: A preoperative PUC result may adversely affect RFS and PFS, particularly in high-risk NMIBC patients. Of particular note, intravesical BCG induction therapy should be administered as an adjunct to TURBT in order to improve RFS and PFS in patientswith T1HG cancer."

In this study, we aimed to determine the predictors of disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with stage-IIIC colon cancer. Methods: From a multicenter database, we retrospectively enrolled 611 patients (355 men and 256 women) who had undergone a potentially curative resection for a stage-IIIC colon adenocarcinoma between 2003 and 2011. The primary endpoint was the 5-year DFS. Results: The median age was 62 years; 213 and 398 patients had right-sided colon cancer (RCC) and left-sided colon cancer (LCC), respectively. The 5-year DFS in all patients was 52.0%; median follow-up time was 35 months (range, 1–134 months). A multivariate Cox regression revealed that female sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19–1.90; P < 0.01), right-sided tumor location (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.29–2.11; P < 0.01), lymphatic invasion (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.08–2.15; P < 0.01) and a high (≥0.4) metastatic lymph node ratio (HR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.63–5.24; P < 0.01) were independent predictors of worse 5-year DFS. Female patients with RCC were 1.79 fold more likely to experience recurrence than male patients with LCC. Conclusion: Female sex and right-sided tumor location are associated with higher tumor recurrence rates in patients with stage-IIIC colon cancers. Aggressive treatment and close surveillance should be planned for patients in these groups."
1001,Association between Serum Uric Acid Level and ESRD or Death in a Korean Population,Kim Kipyo,2020,대한의학회,"Background: Serum uric acid (SUA) is recognized as a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and mortality. However, there is controversy as to whether a high or low level of SUA is related to the risk of CKD progression or death, and whether it differs between males and females.
Methods: We included 143,762 adults who underwent voluntary health screening between 1995 and 2009 in Korea. For each sex, we divided participants into sex-specific quintiles according to SUA levels and compared end-stage renal disease (ESRD) incidence and mortality between the groups with low and high SUA levels and those with middle SUA levels. Sex-specific Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed for ESRD and all-cause mortality.
Results: Among the 143,762 participants, 0.2% (n = 272) developed ESRD. The hazard ratio (HR) of ESRD was higher in the highest (adjusted HR, 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18–3.84) and lowest (adjusted HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.02–3.51) SUA quintiles than in the middle SUA quintile in males and the highest SUA quintile in females (adjusted HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.10–4.84). Four-point three percent (n = 6,215) of participants died during a mean follow-up period of 157 months. The hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality was higher in the highest SUA quintile than in the middle SUA quintile in males (adjusted HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.03–1.28) and females (adjusted HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01–1.35).
Conclusion: Elevated levels of SUA are associated with increased risk for ESRD and all-cause mortality in both sexes. Low levels of SUA might be related to ESRD and death only in males, showing U-shaped associations. Our findings suggest sex-specific associations between SUA levels and ESRD development and mortality."
1002,Effects of Smoking on Long-Term Clinical Outcomes and Lung Cancer in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction,Su Nam Lee,2021,대한심장학회,"Background and Objectives: Smoking is well-established as a risk factor for coronary artery disease. However, recent studies demonstrated favorable results, including reduced mortality, among smokers, which are referred to as the “smoker's paradox”. This study examined the impact of smoking on clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
Methods: Patients with AMI undergoing PCI between 2004 and 2014 were enrolled and classified according to smoking status. The primary endpoint was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization.
Results: Among the 10,683 patients, 4,352 (40.7%) were current smokers. Smokers were 10.7 years younger and less likely to have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, stroke, and prior PCI. Smokers had less MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.644; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.594–0.698; p<0.001) and cardiac death (HR, 0.494; 95% CI, 0.443–0.551; p<0.001) compared to nonsmokers during the 5 years in an unadjusted model. However, after propensity-score matching, smokers showed higher risk of MACE (HR, 1.125; 95% CI, 1.009–1.254; p=0.034) and cardiac death (HR, 1.190; 95% CI, 1.026–1.381; p=0.022). Smoking was a strong independent predictor of lung cancer (propensity-score matched HR, 2.749; 95% CI, 1.416–5.338; p=0.003).
Conclusions: In contrast to the unadjusted model, smoking is associated with worse cardiovascular outcome and higher incidence of lung cancer after adjustment of various confounding factors. This result can be explained by the characteristics of smokers, which were young and had fewer comorbidities.NN"
1003,호기성 생물막을 이용한 HRT 변화에 따른 오염물질 제거,안광호 /Kwangho Ahn,2012,한국환경과학회,"In this study, an experiment was conducted on influent water with low concentrations of organic matter, such as river water or secondary treatment water of a sewage treatment plant, according to HRT changes by using aerobic biofilm. In the biofilm process, as the biofilm increases in thickness, the inner membrane can be low in oxygen transfer rate and become anaerobic conditions, while the detachment of biomass from biofilm occurs. To overcome these limitations in the detachment of microorganisms in biofilm, the yarn, which was made from poly propylene(PP), was weaved and manufactured into a tube. Then, a test was carried out by injecting air so that the interior of the biofilm could create aerobic conditions.
The results of the experiment showed that the removal efficiency of TCODcr reached 66.1∼81.2% by HRT 2hr, and 50.9∼61.8% after HRT 1 hr. The removal efficiency of SCODcr was 45.9 to 55.1% by HRT 1hr, and 26.1% in HRT 0.5hr, showing the highest removal efficiency in HRT 1hr. The SS removal efficiency was at 81.8 to 94.6%, and the effluent SS concentration was very low, indicating less than 2.2 mg/L in all HRT's. As a result, the SCODcr and NH4+-N that were removed per specific surface area and attached to microbial biofilm showed the highest efficiency in HRT 1hr with 8.37 gSCODcr/m2·d, 2.93 gNH4+-N/m2·d. From the result of reviewing the characteristics of biofilm growth, microorganisms were found to be attached, and increased by 36 days. Later, they decreased in number through detachment, but showed a tendency to increase again 41 days later due to microbial reproduction.In this study, an experiment was conducted on influent water with low concentrations of organic matter, such as river water or secondary treatment water of a sewage treatment plant, according to HRT changes by using aerobic biofilm.

1004,"The Effect of Induction Chemotherapy Using Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and Fluorouracil on Survival in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Meta-Analysis",김률 /Ryul Kim,2016,대한암학회,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the survival of patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC) undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) alone with that of patients undergoing induction chemotherapy (IC) using docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) followed by CRT.
Materials and Methods A search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases was performed in April 2015 and abstracts from the American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings (2008-2014) were reviewed. Summaries of the results were pooled using a fixed-effect model, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane tool.
Results A total of six relevant trials comprising 1,280 patients were identified. There was no statistically significant overall survival (OS) advantage for TPF prior to CRT (TPF/CRT) over CRT alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.09; p=0.339). Progression- free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in the TPF/CRT arms (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.95; p=0.009). Patients with non-oropharyngeal LA-HNSCC obtained the greatest OS and PFS benefits from TPF (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.99; p=0.043 and HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.94; p=0.022, respectively). The complete response rate was significantly increased (risk ratio [RR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.56; p < 0.001), and the distant metastasis rate tended to decrease (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.04; p=0.071) in the TPF/CRT arms.
Conclusion IC with TPF followed by CRT is not superior to CRT alone for OS. However, PFS and the complete response rate were significantly improved in the TPF/CRT arms. TPF/CRT for patients with nonoropharyngeal LA-HNSCC provided clear survival advantages."
1005,Effects of hormone therapy on recurrence in endometrial cancer survivors: a nationwide study using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database,조현웅 /Hyun-Woong Cho,2019,대한부인종양학회,"Objective: The aim of this study was to verify the effects of hormone therapy (HT) on recurrence in endometrial cancer (EC) survivors using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database.
Methods: Using the HIRA claims database, we identified all Korean women who were newly diagnosed with EC and underwent surgical staging between 2010 and 2013. Patient characteristics such as age, HT exposure, lymphadenectomy, and adjuvant therapy were evaluated. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the recurrence of EC.
Results: The mean follow-up time of all 5,667 eligible patients was 47.5 months. Of these, 847 (14.9%) received HT. Recurrence was seen in 446 (7.8%) patients. Univariate analysis revealed an increased recurrence rate in patients older than 50 years (HR=2.05; 95% CI=1.62–2.63), patients with high-risk EC (HR=24.51; 95% CI=18.63–32.35), and patients who underwent lymphadenectomy (HR=1.52; 95% CI=1.21–2.03), and a reduced recurrence rate in patients who received HT (HR=0.62; 95% CI=0.46–0.83). Multivariate analysis confirmed the significant increase in recurrence in patients older than 50 years (HR=1.47; 95% CI=1.14–1.89) and in patients with high-risk EC (HR=23.90; 95% CI=18.12–31.51). HT did not increase the recurrence rate of EC (HR=0.81; 95% CI=0.31–2.10).
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that HT does not increase disease recurrence in EC survivors, despite lack of data that could affect the outcome..."
1006,Apparent diffusion coefficient as a valuable quantitative parameter for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma,백동원 /Dong Won Baek,2020,대한혈액학회,"BackgroundThis study attempted to identify novel prognostic factors in patients with newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated 67 patients diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS) tumors. The enrollment criteria were as follows: i) pathologic diagnosis of CNS lympho-ma, ii) no evidence of systemic involvement, iii) no evidence of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection or other immunodeficiencies, and iv) MRI scans available at diagnosis. Fifty-two patients met these criteria and were enrolled.ResultsThe 3-year overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival rates were 69.7% and 45.6%, respectively, with a median follow-up duration of 36.2 months. OS of patients with low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was lower than those with higher ADC. Multivariate analysis revealed that old age (＞60 yr) [hazard ratio (HR), 20.372; P=0.001], Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≥2 (HR, 10.429; P＜0.001), higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (HR, 7.408; P=0.001), and low ADC (HR, 0.273; P=0.009) were associated with lower OS. We modified the conventional prognostic scoring system using low ADC, old age (＞60 yr), ECOG PS ≥2, and higher LDH. The risk of death was categorized as high (score 3-4), intermediate-2 (score 2), inter-mediate-1 (score 1), and low (score 0), with three-year OS rates of 33.5%, 55.4%, 88.9%, and 100%, respectively.ConclusionADC demonstrated significant prognostic value for long-term survival in patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL. Low ADC was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor, suggesting that ADC obtained from MRI can improve the current prognostic scoring system."

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in a public hospital between January 2017 and December 2017. The subjects included elderly patients residing in NHs and diagnosed with pneumonia in the emergency room. Data on age, gender, comorbidities, laboratory findings, pneumonia severity index score (PSI), and CURB-65 (Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, and Age 65 or older) were entered into an electronic database.
Results: A total of 439 patients were enrolled during the study period. The mean age was 82.1±8.0 years; 195 (44.4%) were men, and 30-day mortality was 21.8%. On multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, cerebrovascular accidents (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.87; P=0.012), chronic renal disease (HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.11-4.67; P=0.024), malignancy (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.04-2.76; P=0.034), lactate (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P<0.001), albumin (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36-0.73; P<0.001), and red cell distribution width (RDW; HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03- 1.19; P=0.007) were independently associated with 30-day mortality. Areas under the curve of PSI, RDW, albumin, lactate, and PSI+RDW+albumin+lactate were 0.690 (95% CI, 0.629-0.751), 0.721 (95% CI, 0.666-0.775), 0.668 (95% CI, 0.607-0.728), 0.661 (95% CI, 0.597-0.726), and 0.801 (95% CI, 0.750-0.852), respectively.
Conclusion: RDW, albumin, lactate and especially the combination of PSI and these factors appear to be major determinants of 30-day mortality in NH residents with pneumonia."
1008,Association Between Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers and the Risk of Lung Cancer Among Patients With Hypertension From the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort,문성지 /Moon SungJi,2020,대한예방의학회,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of lung cancer in relation to angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) use among patients with hypertension from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with hypertension who started to take antihypertensive medications and had a treatment period of at least 6 months. We calculated the weighted hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of lung cancer associated with ARB use compared with calcium channel blocker (CCB) use using inverse probability treatment weighting.
Results: Among a total of 60 469 subjects with a median follow-up time of 7.8 years, 476 cases of lung cancer were identified. ARB use had a protective effect on lung cancer compared with CCB use (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.96). Consistent findings were found in analyses considering patients who changed or discontinued their medication (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.77), as well as for women (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.93), patients without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.00), never-smokers (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.99), and non-drinkers (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.97). In analyses with different comparison antihypertensive medications, the overall protective effects of ARBs on lung cancer risk remained consistent.
Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that ARBs could decrease the risk of lung cancer. More evidence is needed to establish the causal effect of ARBs on the incidence of lung cancer."
1009,A Comprehensive Prognostic Stratification for Patients with Metastatic Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma,조강수 /KANG SU CHO,2008,연세대학교의과대학,"Purpose: To develop a reliable prognostic model for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on features readily available in common clinical settings. Patients and Methods: A total of 197 patients with RCC who underwent nephrectomy and immunotherapy from 1995 to 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. Their mean age was 55.1 ±11.8 yrs (24-83yrs) and mean survival time from metastasis was 22.6 ±20.2mos (3-120mos). The impact of 24 clinicopathological features on disease specific survival was investigated. Results: On univariate analysis, constitutional symptoms, sarcomatoid differentiation, tumor necrosis, multiple primary lesions, liver metastasis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), thrombocytosis, alkaline phosphatase, hematocrit, T stage, N stage, and nuclear grade had significant influence on survival (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed the following features associated with survival: sarcomatoid differentiation [hazard ratio (HR)=2.99, p<0.001], liver metastasis (HR=2.09, p= 0.002), ECOG-PS (HR=1.95, p= 0.005), N stage (HR=1.94, p=0.002), and number of metastatic sites (HR=1.76, p=0.003). An individual prognostic score was defined as the sum of the weight of these features. According to prognostic scores, patients could be subdivided into 3 groups: low risk (score 0), intermediate risk (score 1 or 2), and high risk (score ≥3). Conclusion: A comprehensive prognostic stratification model was developed to predict survival and stratify patients for prospective clinical trials."
