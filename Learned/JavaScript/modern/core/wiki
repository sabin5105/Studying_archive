### 👨🏻‍💻Personal notes👨🏻‍💻

<hr>

# **Hello, world!**
## **\<script\>**
the script should be like this in HTML file
```HTML
<script>console.log("Hello, world!");</script>
```
it could be placed anywhere

<br>
<hr>
<br>

## **external scripts**
```HTML 
<script src="/PATH/myscripts.js"></script>
```
the benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its **_cache_** which reduces traffic and makes pages faster

* if src is set, the script content is ignored
```HTML
<script src="/PATH/myscripts.js">
console.log("hello, world!"); // the content is ignored
</script>
```

<br>
<hr>
<br>

## **Summary**
* The type <span style='color: #808080'>type</span> and <span style='color: #808080'>language</span> attributes are not required
* A script in an external file can be inserted with 
* ```HTML
  <script src="/PATH/myscripts.js"></script>
  ```

# **Code structure**

## **Nested comments are not supported**

Such code will die with an error
```Javascript
/*
  /* nested comment ?!? */
*/
alert( 'World' );
```


<br>
<hr>

# **"use strict"**

After the ECMAScript 5 (ES5), new features are added and modified to the language. 

So, to keep the old code working, gotta explicitly enable them with a special directive - 하위 호환성 문제
